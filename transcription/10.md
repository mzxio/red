i miss that stupid couch.

“once you leave you can never come back.”

i’ve left plenty of places. there’s always a return, but never going back to what it was. even if you never leave, there’s no going back. just with these words and drawings and shit. trying to keep a dying world alive in my memory. like cut flowers, already disconnected from real life, given a little extra time. 

every morning, this place. writing to write, also to understand. to find things that are already here, just hidden. so much.

what do you do when you have no time? when you have only a little you can say to encompass something so big?

i sat on the park bench and wrote the words hastily but quietly. it wasn’t my hood. they were checking me out. i wrote a page, threw it out, wrote another. i folded the words and slipped them in the book, left behind the bench. i wonder how long.
