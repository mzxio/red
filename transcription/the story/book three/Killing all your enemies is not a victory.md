### Killing all your enemies is not a victory.

When there is no one left, there is no chance for anything else ever again. It is nothing but completion. An ending. Death in totality.

Failure. 

When you stand among the bones of your enemies, one enemy remains: you. You are the enemy. Turn your weapons on yourself or go on forever perceiving other enemies around every corner. If there are always enemies, there is a reason to keep going. If there are no enemies, that reason is gone.

Your enemies may be forgotten, but they will never be gone.
