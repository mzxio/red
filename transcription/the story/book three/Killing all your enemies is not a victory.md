### Killing all your enemies is not a victory. 

When there is no one left, there is no chance for anything else ever again. It is nothing but completion. An ending. Death in totality. Failure to find alternatives. 

When you stand among the bones of your enemies, one enemy remains: yourself. By then you have become your own enemy. Keep going on forever imagining new enemies around every corner, or turn your weapons on yourself. 

If there are always enemies, there is a reason to keep going. If there are no enemies, that reason is gone. In this way your enemies may be separate, but they end up defining you.
