### Only a monument remained to the way things were before.

Old rules etched in stone, the epitaph of a forgotten empire. From this spot you can see all they ruled, all around. One chief with many tribes. A great consensus-finder, builder of walls and roofs, planter of the first harvest, offspring of the great.

Read the laws upon the stone. The chief was cruel. Burned as many houses as built. Devastator of souls. Another stone on the road of empire. No one here remembers, no one here is left. Their lands are dead now, abandoned. Cut off. Only the bones are left. Still the monument stands. For another thousand years if no one disturbs it. The cycle of empire rises and collapses again and again. The people donâ€™t much change. Only the land remains, waiting and knowing. 

Leave the past where it is. Let the land erase its memory in its own time.
