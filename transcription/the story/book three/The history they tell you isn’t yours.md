### The history they tell you isn’t yours.

It’s not even their history. It’s the history that they made up to tell themselves. The way they wanted it to happen. Their excuses. Whatever doesn’t fit, discarded. Any story outside theirs, unworthy of telling unless it serves them. 

It is in their interests to make us into savages. Wild animals. Beasts that attack in the night and kill you in your sleep. Never mind that’s what they did to us. We lived here, cared for this land for an age before they came. Will they last as long? No. 

Their way is ravenous, destructive. They will strip the land of all its riches and move on, leaving us with whatever ruined earth is left. They are the savages, the beasts of civilization. They say civilization is good, the epoch of our lives. We should want to be civilized. But I see what civilized people do, who they are. 

They are nothing to be emulated or revered.
