### In the heart of the ancient plan. 

Towns and cities rising from villages and camps. Growing in concentric patterns. At the center of each a fire, whatever fire is at the heart of your house. A hovel with a weak foraged supply of wood, a city square with a church of sun-worshippers. Whatever fire, whatever gravity to hold us. 

Connections with the outside, respiration in goods and supplies and people. Livestock, stores. Defense. 

Someone wants to extinguish the fire or take it for themselves. Will you let them? No? thus begins another cycle of war. 

Better defense, better attack. 

Still they want the fire, even though so much time has passed and we canâ€™t find much different between them and us.

A period of stasis, equilibrium. The land breathes with the settlement. People go about their business. Networks of settlements form. More roads, more trade. The composition of the network influences the shape of its components. 

Some settlements swell, some shrink, some vanish.
