# trying to forget, even when there is no forgetting.

the long walk, beyond the village in its valley, to the water. across the water, slow timelessness, to another valley. and on and on. the mountains, rivers, fields. birds flutter and sing. the long dry road to the mesa, lonely and forgotten. the infinite desolation, nothing but dust and scrub and burning sun. slowly walking higher and higher. rolling hills. scrub turns to grass and trees. the clouds come. rain at last. looking back and seeing the road stretching beyond sight. rocks and grass and then another valley, bright and living. steaming in the late day sun. the river, the village. one big circle as if i never left. this is a different place though, with different stories. a long road from here to there.
