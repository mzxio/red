### Camping in the ruins of ancient cities

Too vast for anyone to build. now These ancestors with their unknowable skills and secret wisdom. We find their remains but never know them as they were. 

Nothing but some stones standing where a sacred site once was. Bones from a forgotten battle, covering the hills far as can be seen. Maybe all weâ€™re doing is looking at our future.
