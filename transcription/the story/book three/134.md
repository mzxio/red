for millennia she walked between the stars.
never stopping, never resting.
longer than the empire that created her. longer than all the children of her cousins ever breathed.
still she walked. always forward, never back, never to anywhere else than her final destination.
only she ever knew where.
no empire decided where we would emerge. for us our only god is the mother.
