### Too many to name. Too many forgotten, or best forgotten.

This place used to be a sea. Dry before that, like it is now. It will be a sea again before long, maybe generations of us. Walk the plains while you can. Flat and smooth, worn down by floods and the grinding of the sea that was. Little cuts of young rivers, running between the ancient hills. 

Some farm this land now. Good for cultivation. All those countless ages of sea life, dying and falling. Corpses collected, compressed, buried. Now we till the ground, churn up their bodies. They break down even more. Almost unrecognizable now.

Crops come in and the farmer takes them to market. We’ll eat the last thing that remembers those ancient creatures, seeds grown from plants that dug deep and consumed their bones.

Eventually the plains will flood and the farmer’s bones will go to join those old forgotten dead, and be buried anew. How many times does the cycle repeat?
