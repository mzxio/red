### Walking down the old train tracks.

Most everyone’s gone home, for the evening or weekend or both. Sun hasn’t quite set. Idling between afternoon and night. Old rundown part of town. Junkyards and overgrown weeds.

Going around the edges, gravel and dirty grass. Places between the fences to slip through. Places to hide. Some days it’s needles and bottles under the trees. Some days it’s riders in caravans. 

There’s a man and his dog I see sometimes. Set up high with a chair. Watching the day, watching his place. I try to go around. Don’t want him to see me cutting through. He yells at me.

“Why would you want to walk so far out of your way?”

I tell him I didn’t want to upset him or the dog. He shakes his head. Comes down, takes my hand, leads me through.

His hand was dry, dirty. On my hand there’s dirt and grease now. Stains where he touched my shoulder. I smell the grease and sweat. Marks of hard work and friendship.

A precious gift in that fading light.
