### Didn’t have to do the work alone.

Weeks getting ready. The ones before left bots. I activated them to help me. We cleared away the debris. Put up a new dome one layer at a time. 

The bots do the work up high. They mostly got it right. 

`You're not climbing up there to fix it.` 

After the dome, a new house.  Salvaged most of the old buildings. Planted seeds in the garden. How long before a harvest? Don’t remember the last thing fresh I ate. 

Long time ago. Before.
