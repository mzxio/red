### No one remembers because no one knows.

Living in two places. Dwelling in the past and the future, all in the present. Different bodies. Friends. Family. Whatever we made from was left of what was here before. The work of building is past. Now the long waiting, watching. 

Keep the lights on. Tend to the garden. Become the custodian.

“In the end there will be no higher calling.”
