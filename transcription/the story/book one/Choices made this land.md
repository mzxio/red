### Choices made this land.

Desert. Wasteland. Infinite desolation. Nothingness and potential, there, just out of reach. Beyond the horizon. Hidden life revealed. Waiting at the shore.

“Don't know where, don't know when.“

We begin by the fire, beset by darkness. Flame reflected in our eyes dulls the light of distant stars. We take up the fire for ourselves. We observe the cycles, honor ancient ceremonies, sing in the old ways. Laughter rings out at the end of sorrow.

Sun traverses sky, horizon to horizon, day upon day. We rise up and fall again. Years pass in shuddering seasons. Wind and water etch their marks upon the face of the earth. We carry the fire.

"Upon entering such a universe, there is no way to return.”
