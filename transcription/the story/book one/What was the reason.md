### What was the reason?

There was one. A reason. Why did we come here? Don’t remember now. It’s been so long. Don’t remember anything. Memory can’t be trusted. Illusion everywhere. Forgetting. It all runs together. Unending, once I forget the forgetting. Was there a time before? Once. There must have been. We weren’t always here. 

`ATTACKED`

Who would have attacked? Nothing worth protecting but the dome. If they couldn’t fix it, would they kill for it?

“Was there anything else?”

`NOT FOUND`
