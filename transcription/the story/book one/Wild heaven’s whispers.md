### Wild heaven’s whispers.

Tamping down the dreams so visions stop. No more screaming from beyond. 

What is madness? Seeing things that aren’t there? How do we really know what is and what isn’t? Can you tell? Is reality what you perceive with your senses, what you can measure with tools or instruments? Sense comes from no one sense, rather it is built up from all senses poured into us. Even the immeasurable ones. Who made these tools, and what are they specialized in? 

“We see so little, can we really trust these eyes?”

“Am I insane?”

What is the difference between vision and delusion? Is a delusion always false? Something that never comes true? Is a vision something that must be true in order to avoid being delusion? What if a thing could be true but never comes to pass? Is a vision of what could have been a delusion, or reality somewhere else that isn’t here? Are all delusions a reality somewhere? 

If a universe was big enough, could anything happen?
