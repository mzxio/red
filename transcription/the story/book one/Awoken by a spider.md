### Awoken by a spider.

In the moment, a fear. Startled. Kicked from dreams. How long has spider been coming into my dreams? Years that I remember. Probably forever. Honored ancients. Beings from the early days, nearly eternal and connected. The web-minders. 

Year after year, visiting me. Waking me with a jump. 

_Jump._

Still the same. Plus one more thing. Grateful. Thank you, spider. Thank you for always showing me the way back to reality. Before I thought you only came to scare me. Now I understand you’ve always been helping me on my way. Keeping me from getting lost.

“Thank you, spider.”
