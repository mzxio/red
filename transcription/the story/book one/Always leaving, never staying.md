### Always leaving, never staying.

Forever ago nomads, drifting through oceans. Little flakes of organisms riding the currents. Year after year, directionless, dragged by the tides. Washing up on shore, laying down roots, holding out leaves. Steady and loose, letting out seeds.

Even trees so firmly planted for an age know their rootless roots, give their seeds to animals to carry far away, or release so the wind can do the job. Even in motionlessness they understand motion, the uncertainty of their own mortality. 

“Where are you?” 

“Here.”

Even unknowing can know. Only later when the animals started asking those questions did they seem contradictory or difficult. In our ancient bones we knew all of these truths. Chaos, motion, perturbations of the void. 

We are everywhere and we are nowhere. We make truth true.
