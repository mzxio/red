### Never thought it would go like this.

Wrecked, forgotten, cold, hurt. Lonely like a force of nature. Impossible doubt. No escape. Marooned. Small and cold and alone. Only by changing the planets and the stars would it be any other way. 

Maybe rest here.

Log says it’s been so many hours, minutes, seconds since the crash. What do those units count for now? Days and nights are different here. Watch the motion of the spheres. 

May yet live to see all these things and more. 

Always over the next ridge. Never seems to come any closer. Maybe after walking a hundred years there’s something else. Keep walking all the way into another age. 

What will I find if I get there? Will there be anything? 

`YOU HAVE ARRIVED`

Arrived, yes. Where?
