### Whistling in the caves. Whispers in the grass. 

Crouched under the moon, telling secrets. Butterfly rests, mosquito tends the fire. Burrowing animals asleep or out hunting. Cool dirt crunches underfoot. Leaves and trees crack and creak. Gray and colorless as the sky. 

“Too many timelines.”

Folded into the mother’s mysteries, her embrace. Disappearing and being reborn. Stillness of infinite motion. The smoke and the fire and the sparks, all that tells. God is everywhere.

“Wherever I was, an odor would arrive in my nose — the perfume of this place.”
