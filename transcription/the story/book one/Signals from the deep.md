### Signals from the deep.

Formless noise. A long pause, low baseline drone, rough harmonies. Modulations. Pulses and tones. Regular. Exact. Wet and bubbling like a stream, uneven in its precision.

The signal repeats. Again and again. Communicating. 

How much presence followed by how much absence? It means something to someone. Nothing to me. Just tones, sounds. They make me feel a certain way. Deep fear. Something is wrong. An alarm?

What is happening? Should I prepare? Is the alarm meant for me? It could be coming from far away. Removed from its original purpose. Propagated and echoed until arriving here.

It goes on and on for a while. Tones. Silence. Again.

Eventually nothing more.

“Did I miss something important?”
