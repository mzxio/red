### Nowhere. Now here.

No-thing. Nothing but here, no matter what here is. Infinity of oblivion. Unbounded, undirected. Absence. Any direction is the same as all direction. No way to say where here ends and there starts.

“It’s all here, nowhere.”

Apart from each other, did thing and no-thing really exist? Or did they just come into being precisely then, at their first encounter? A violent meeting in imbalance. Kicking and screaming. Twisted and broken. Bloody, like a birth. 

Breaking through the wreckage. Shattering the quiet dark. Taking something into nothing. Even information taints a flawless void, carrying memories and stories through nowhere into somewhere. To name a thing to separate it, to bring it out of the void.

There is so much nothing in every something. Clear away every thing. Practice no-thing. Study the balance. Absolute void must exist apart, held by opposing forces. A carefully crafted realm in equilibrium. No-thing-ness, some-thing-ness.

“Oil and water in a cup.”
