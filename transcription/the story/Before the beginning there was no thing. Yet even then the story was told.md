### Before the beginning there was no thing.  
Yet even then the story was told.

Time holds many stories. This is one of them.

We are all in the story. We can never be erased, but our stories may be forgotten when there is no one left to tell them. 

The story was told before the beginning, it will be told after the end.

Our stories are the stories of the universe.

Tell old stories. Make new stories. Cast your stories into the void. 

The universe begins.
