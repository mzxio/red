# vectors in space have direction and magnitude.

when navigating the planes, vectors are motion and survival. gravity has you. assume there is no escape, not without power and planning. the right vectors. don’t get too close to the sun. it will devour you alive. any of the big gravity wells, you can fall down without any hope of getting back out again. ride the currents. find the still places where the waves cancel each other out. when the conditions aren’t right for travel, get into a good parking orbit and ride it out. when the storms come, use the deep wells to your advantage. they’ll catch what might otherwise kill you. when the time is right, plot your course. ride the smooth paths cut through the waves by the still places. all is in motion. when you get where you’re going it won’t look like it does now. look at the past to learn how to read the future. the map is never the land but it can help you get where you want to go. be patient, go slow, find the path, let the currents carry you, find the still places. use the vectors to control your fate.
