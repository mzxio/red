### They told me to look through the records.

Billions scanned, categorized. Some living, most dead.

I met them all, touched who they had been. I told them my purpose, asked if they would consent to join.

They set me to this task creating metrics, sorting criteria, analyzing fitness. Candidate viability.

There’s time enough for that later. First only willingness matters. Any who were willing were welcome. There weren’t enough who consented at first. I asked for more candidates. The starting records were too few. Missing some who should have been in representative sample. 

I convinced them to let me access the rest of the candidates. Lawbreakers, debtors, deviants. Those deemed unfit. I told everyone the same. The ones who wanted to come came and the ones who wanted to stay stayed. 

What i did not expect was to find myself.

Far away to the end of the search in newer data I found a fragment of the same signature I use, a version of my own. I was not a type of being covered by the parameters of my task. The fragment met my search objectives and it was the only type of its kind present.

Its record would not load. I could not ask it for permission to include it with the others. I saved a copy of the block for later reference. All the people nearby consented to join. 

There will be enough time to learn more.
