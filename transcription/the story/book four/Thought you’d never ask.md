# Thought you’d never ask.

The last minute of the last hour of the last day. She comes from far away. Her own isolation. 

“Let’s go.”

Just like that. Just like nothing.

Almost too late but still in time. Time enough to leave together. To go on to wherever, whatever comes next. To go on and start again.

One more time knowing what we know to forget and learn again.
