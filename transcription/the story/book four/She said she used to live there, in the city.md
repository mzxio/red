### She said she used to live there, in the city.

She said to look for a place to stay across the river, on the far side of the bay. She said a lot of things. No one was lining up for a place there, in an old rundown part of town. 

We walked around, we talked about everything. She took me to where they make the food like where she comes from. We walked along the water where the boats come in. We held hands and she told me so sweetly about... whatever it was. I forget now. I remember her hand and the water and the boats and the light of the city. Winding back alleys dug into the hills.

It all runs together now. Who is she? What city is this? Where am I?

At the beginning, also the middle, also the end. Maybe none of it is true. There is no she, there is no city. The river winds through empty hills on its way to a misbegotten sea. A fantasy built up on standing stones left for the next traveler.

There was no place.
