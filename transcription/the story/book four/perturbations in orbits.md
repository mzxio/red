# perturbations in orbits

mechanics. what are the dynamics of solar powered spacecraft? universal gravitational constant  _G_, in n-body problems. must account for _C_, the speed of light. where a body is and where it appears to be are two different things. update your calculations again when you get close. inaccurate answers are simpler and less expensive than accurate ones. sometimes you don’t need high accuracy, when you’re still far away. getting closer you start to see the difference between reality and estimation. even at sublight speeds before relativity really kicks in, nothing is quite as it seems. save some fuel for last minute course corrections. if you’re going too fast and you fly off into the void that’s (your) own problem. intercepts are tricky and costly. sometimes impossible. double check your math. no one is coming to save you if you miss. trust your computer. stay patient and go slow if you’re not sure. if it all goes wrong, don’t worry. someone may pick you up, in a million years or so.
