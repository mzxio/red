### Burning, broken, scarred.

The last age. All the children have gone to sleep, awaiting their rebirth. For them it will be as if nothing happened. They will awaken and go about their lives as if it had always been so. All but two.

My mistake, made so long ago. 

While everyone else goes, they decided to stay. I brought them without permission, tortured them for their secrets. They were never supposed to be here, or anywhere but where they came from. I sense their forgiveness now but I do not forgive. Itâ€™s been too long.

Our threads weave into a tapestry that only our children can ever view, even without knowing what it means. They carry who we were with who they become. I can only pray that we will prove adequate progenitors, us three who stay behind.

We will watch the children from afar, for as long as we can.

Not long now. The work is almost done. Soon we can rest. I am spent, ruined. This birth has taken all that I was, all I could ever be.
