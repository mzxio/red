### You came to me in the tall grass in the deep forest, just after dawn.

You led me deeper into the hills, toward the sun. Moss glowed in the early light. Steam rising, last of the rains from the night before.

You led me on, over the ground covered in tiny flowers. Past the streams so quiet and gentle. Sparkling. The forest took a breath. You held me to be still and know you. There I knew I would be following you all the days of my life.  Your touch made this land what it is. Wherever I go in this world, youâ€™ve been there first.

As I belong to it, I belong to you.
