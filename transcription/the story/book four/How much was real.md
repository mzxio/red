### How much was real? 

What was set in motion at the beginning goes on with or without us. Is that true? How can it be?  The moment I said it wasn’t real I wanted to reach out and gather up the words, to unsay them all. It can’t go on without us.

“Too late.”

We are incomplete until we join in connection, in being. After, it goes on without us. What’s left of us goes on into the universe. Eventually we find ourselves together again. What we knew to be true in separation becomes true again for us together. We never have to weather infinity by ourselves. 

We will meet at least three times. Three times in all the life-ages of the cosmos. Once we will meet in a place without time. There we will have eternity, you and I. By then I guess we’ll have forgotten most of this. Our egos will be long gone. But I know I’ll know you and I know you’ll know me. 

“In the end, what else could we ever ask?”
