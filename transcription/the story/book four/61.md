is it that obvious? do all see but one, laid bare while believing anything else? or just obvious to you, for whom there is so little mystery? and what about your understanding? what you see and what is shown can be so different. do you ever change what you see to match? or do you already draw from life and there is nothing to change because your vision is already up to date? or is it one way? do i see you or do you see me or do we see shady reflections of ourselves, only revised when itâ€™s proven that no, we are not the same? or is it everyone all the same and our variations are to be included?
