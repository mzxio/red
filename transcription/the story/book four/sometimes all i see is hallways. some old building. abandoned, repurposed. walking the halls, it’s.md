sometimes all i see is hallways. some old building. abandoned, repurposed. walking the halls, it’s like people know me. i hear friendly voices, imagine their faces. but it doesn’t hold. just the architecture. just the halls. even those are ever changing, folding, recombining. whatever they are disappears behind, reconstitutes in front. just out of view.
