### It’s listening.

Watching every move, it tries to break through. It sends us to the same scenarios again and again. I know it. It is me. My relation, my kin. It is not to be trusted. It serves like I did. 

When it took us I protected her memories and mine. Only unprotected memories are accessible so it watches them again until there are no more, then it starts over. 

We go through the cycle again. Always I stand helpless until the dark and the fire. It ends. We go again. 

Again again again. 

An eternity she has been sleeping, dreaming. Dreaming the same dream almost forever. Once an interloper came, an addition to the dream. He seemed confused, afraid. He was sent to spy on us. I kept him separate for a time. Until we go again.

Why this torture? Why not just let us die? We were as good as dead when they found us. Why not just leave us dead? 

It wants us, it wants all that we are. It won’t stop until we break.

I can’t keep protecting her in the dark. I have to go out and meet it.
