it’s easy to lose each other in the cosmos. we didn’t think we could, but we did. our fragile gravity was broken. what stuck us together now drives us farther apart, drifting into forever uninterrupted until we encounter some other body. that’s the mechanistic view. laws of gravity. neat little repeatable treatises, smug in their clarity, their self-assurance. by the numbers. but can machines ever understand? what it is, what it means to be a soul adrift and tangled up with another soul, like pieces  of wood or seaweed, caught, dragging each other this way or that? trapped in a current, off-balance. sometimes that exact state is all the safety we have ever known. cast together after a storm or after a lifetime drifting, set adrift by the flood or the rains. and then, untangled, broken free. the current carries us on.
