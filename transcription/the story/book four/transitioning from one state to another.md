# transitioning from one state to another.

far from here. navigating a sluggish course on a swift current. yesterday is gone but still lives on. move along, nothing left to see here. force the ritual, coerce the words, lay them down and pretend that they are good for something. that they are worthwhile. parading the corpses of defeated opponents through the streets, they’ll come out to throw stones at the desiccated evil king, make crude remarks about the broken disfigured queen. the ancient streets with their markets, self important dignitaries, no sewers, shit everywhere. always the tang of corpse, the constant reminder of death on the wind. outsider far from the city. the village is gone. flooded, burned, abandoned, lying fallow. its story is not yet done. the city shudders through time. its enemies come and burn it down and slaughter everyone, but it grows again as if from the roots. the city begets an army that destroys its enemies and here we are. this gruesome display of victory and indulgence. this parade of the dead and the damned all jeer. the enemies are beaten, their lands lie fallow now too. from afar there is no difference between them, but “us” and “them” have different meanings for everyone. leave the markets and head for the hills. don’t look too hard at the dead displayed upon the walls. soon they’ll all know what it is to be so far beyond reach.
