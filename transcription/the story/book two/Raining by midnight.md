### Raining by midnight.

The park was empty except for us. Standing at the water, drinking from a flask, watching the wet misty glow of the city rise to meet the clouds.

Uptown, looking for a place to eat. Soggy and leaden, no way to get a light, no way to see. Blurry and stumbling until there, a sparkling sign, the smell of chopped meat and onions, the piercing strike of metal against metal, fragrant steam mixing with the stink. 

Time to go, to find a cab, to shiver in the back seat. Transverse, bridge between dimensions. Black-white-black-white-black. Accelerating, chasing, tearing through the night.

`TRIP IN PROGRESS.`

Ripping out a loose thread. It all starts to unravel.

Swimming from the drink, from the anticipation. Sweating and dripping, screaming back into the night. One step closer to the end.  Flipping the wet page to the next chapter, the last chapter. Dragged through time and space for one last encounter. One last tense chilly argument. One more lie. One more truth.

Waiting through one last rainy city night for the sunrise.
