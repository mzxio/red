### Late for the train.

Missed appointments, considerations. Snubbed, spurned, ignored. The train pulls out, carrying its usual cargo.

We are together finally. You make me go down on you extra long to make up for the snubbing. 

Awake. 

Pale walls, strange place. Not home, not now, not then, not later. Nowhere. The tunnel collapses. Jump into a different dimension. Far away. No trains, no nights or days. Just daze. Your memory fades, falling back into me. 

It’s us again, carrying more than one inside the shell of one. Time flashes and slides, unconnected to anything seen or sensed. Slipping in fits and starts, uneven, unpredictable. Falling, falling, faster into nothing. 

Awaken. 

Another place, another unknown. 

The thing that’s supposed to be there seems uneasy in its usual place.
