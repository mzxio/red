### One year past the hour of reckoning. 

All is as it has been forever.

“Right?”

No memory of days before. This is reality now. The ones who remember, well, for what? Why do they hold on to a reality that no longer exists here? What good are their warnings? What values lurk in their nostalgia? 

An entire year of this and all else has been washed away. Now we live here. We follow the routines, the patterns set out for us. When the patterns move we move too. Never mind that those patterns are as artificial and arbitrary as we are. We become the shape we’re molded into. Everything else is meaningless, except for a few. The ones with their own mold. their own arbitrary shapes and routines. The crazy ones.

One year past the hour of reckoning and only a lunatic can save us.
