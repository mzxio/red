what if it was us? i know it’s not but what if? would you know? would anyone know? what if somehow it all came down to two people standing at the water’s edge? one walking away, wrecking chances for anything else but what came to pass. not just for the one or the two but for all? is that even possible? or does the death inside and the death outside have a different origin, they just happened to come to fruition at the same time(?)  am i a reflection of it, or is it a reflection of me? not that we could go back and fix it anyway, for us or for them. the die was cast. still sometimes i can’t help but wonder. what if it was us?
