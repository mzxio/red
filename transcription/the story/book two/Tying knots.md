### Tying knots.

“Wonder what so-and-so is doing now.”

Ruins by the highway. Next services forever away. The tank won’t hold that much gas. You’ll have to walk the rest. What is gas anyway? A forgotten century’s obsession. Soon something else. Roll up. Ghosts in the bathroom. Toilets are clean. Same thing that keeps anything else from happening. Infinite regret.

Play it forward. Crumble. Not all at once. Slow change. Good becomes just ok. Ok becomes bad. Someone from the old world knows they’ll share the same fate. Pull one piece out and the entire thing comes down.

The bones of truck stops bleach in desert sun and, wind blows the ghosts out to sea. No palace here for any of us. No one but the ones we lost. The ones we left. The ones we’ll never see again.
