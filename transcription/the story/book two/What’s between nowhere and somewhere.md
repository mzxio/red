### What’s between nowhere and somewhere?

How would you know when you got there? Does nowhere become somewhere while we’re standing in it? Standing, sitting, driving, crawling. Different experiences, all leading to the same place.

Nowhere. The gateway to heaven. We all pass through here on our way, one at a time. The river becomes a dusty creek. The ferryman used to pilot the boat, now he drives a cab. 

Losing perspective.  Can’t tell what is in or out. Forced perspective, overemphasis. Shapes become dreamlike. Is that bridge over the stream, a doorway in the hall? 

“Where am I?”
