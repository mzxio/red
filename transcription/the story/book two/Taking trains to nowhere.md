### Taking trains to nowhere. 

Staying on the express too many stops in the wrong direction. Keen and alert in a strange new place. Too far to walk back? Getting to the other platform. Waiting a long time for the train to take you back where you know the streets.

It was the last train and it’s late and you’re stuck looking for a safe place. Going to what’s familiar, not straying too far. The train station becomes the anchor tethering you to reality. If it disappears, maybe the world you remember never existed at all.

This was always your reality.
