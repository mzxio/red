### The longest day.

Before anyone else knew, we knew. We knew all of this world was crumbling, washing out to sea. We drove like driving was all there’s ever been. We drove like our lives depended on it. We went farther than we’d ever gone before.

 Fingers entwined, hand in hand, we raced into the new world, grabbing at anything we found along the way. Later it will burn and all that made it good will shrink and wither and die. Like all worlds, eventually. Created and destroyed. What came after, rushing in to fill every empty space?

Our world was not to be. Not for long. An illusion, a nearly impossible divide. Paper over unchecked depths. Inside we had just enough to start again, to make another world. Instead we spent our last moments on the road. 

We were lost.
