### The longest day. 

Before anyone else knew, we knew. We knew all of this world was crumbling, washing out to sea. We drove like driving was all there’s ever been. We drove like our lives depended on it. We went farther than we’d ever gone. We knew we had to make a new world. 

Fingers entwined, hand in hand, we raced into that new world, grabbing at anything we found along the way. Later it will burn and all that made it good will shrink and wither and die. Like all worlds, eventually. 

Ours was not to be. Not for long. An illusion. Paper over unchecked depths. A nearly impossible divide. Inside was just enough to start again. To make another world. Instead we spent our last moments on the road. Created and destroyed. What came after, rushing in to fill every empty space?

We were lost.
