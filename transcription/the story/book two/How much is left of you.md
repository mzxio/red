### How much is left of you?

Who has the most of you? Where, in what timeline? Which intersection is the one where I find you?

This universe is too big to search everywhere. I don’t have much time left. This timeline is collapsing, reforming itself. Soon I won’t be able to go back to where we crossed paths. That meeting could cease to exist. I will be left with a vague sense tugging at memory. Somewhere, that way, my only measurements. There’s no way to be sure.

The people of this world, most of them missed the hour of their reckoning. They thought something else was happening. But we knew. We were right there. Lingering by the river, at the shore. We had our reckoning, now they are having theirs. 

My world ended when I left and went to another reality, when I traveled forward to escape the dissolution. Now this world too.

I can go no farther forward. Whatever happens next, I’m stuck here.
