### Pulling at threads. Ripping at the tear.

“Who stole this land, and how long ago was that?”

Pull the thread. Pull for ego and tribe, for god and country. Pull as if your very existence depends on it. No way to be graceful now. No matter how beautiful the tapestry, no matter the cost. Pull.

“The earth doesn’t belong to us. We belong to her. One day she calls us back.”
