### Pulling at threads. Ripping at the tear.

Pull the thread. Pull for ego and tribe, for god and country. Pull as if your very existence depended on it. No way to be graceful now. No matter how beautiful the tapestry, no matter the cost, pull.

“Who stole this land, and how long ago was that?”

“The earth doesn’t belong to us. We belong to her. One day she calls us back.”
