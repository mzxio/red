### We never really knew each other at all, did we? 

I never could get you to listen. You never could get me to understand. I still feel betrayed. Guessing you do too. But our dream, our sense, that I could never shake.

The more I remember, the more cracks I see. The more I know why everything fell apart. I’m so mad that you wouldn’t listen, that you pushed on when I told you to stop. That you had the nerve to call me all those things afterward. You forced me to hold your all but only a little of me was too much. You were worth it and there was nothing I could ever do.

Smokers sleeping on the floor, idle dreamers and wishers. Seers of the unseen, listeners of the unheard. The hills were dark and rich and fragrant. You said such sweet words and I was glad to know you, to know someone else who loved and craved to make unrealities real. 

Why wasn’t it enough?
