### Birdsong.

Someone said that at the end of a slaughter all that’s left is blood and shit and birds in the trees. As long as something remains, there are the birds. Until all is blasted and ruined, reduced to soot and ash, minerals, components. Why would they care about our blasted hellscape?

The wreckage is still warm, still smoldering. Picking through melted shapes that were once familiar. No coded impressions. All is noise and torment, blank vision. Until a curve comes into focus, there a familiar pattern emerges. Shock, horror. What was just rubble and ruin becomes a familiar shape. A corpse, an artifact. It looked like junk, like nothing. In focus nothing becomes blackened bones, charred flesh congealed. All the components that should never be separated, scattered carelessly. 

Casual horror. The ones left living are shocked and then numbed. What was abhorrent becomes usual. Picking through the rubble, they find what’s left. 

The birds sing through it all.
