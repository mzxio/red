### Nothing is real until we make it real.

In imagination a thing can be real for one person. In stories it can be real for all.  So much depends on individuals who simply decide to act a certain way, do a certain thing. When they make it real, they leave the door open for others to follow.

It will seem so obvious. Foolish. To live in such enlightened times when we have at last thought these things! Forgetting days when things not such a way, and the days when such a thing wasn’t even real. Someone came here before, and their story was forgotten.

“Why didn’t anyone think of this sooner?” 

“That’s just the way things are.”

“It’s just fantasy.”

Our view was too narrow, exclusive. To the unwise, what does not exist within their view does not exist at all. When an idea comes directly from imagination and goes to story, it skips the manifestation required to satisfy unbelievers. Later when fantasy becomes reality they’ll believe.

Thus the fool becomes the prophet.
