### Here no one knows me.

Press of bodies, loose and tight. Horns honk. Tires wheeze on ragged pavement. Deliveries delivered.  Bloodshot-faced moneymakers boisterously outdoing each other at the corners. Snowy mist rolling in. Cold wind. Passerby clutch jackets to themselves. Keeping eyes averted.  

Invisibility is valuable. 

Some invisibility works because others wish you to be invisible. To any who pay attention, this falls apart. Failing adherence to certain rules transforms anyone into a deviant. Shameful, to be ignored or ground underfoot. From unseen normal to frightening miscreant. 

Invisibility in the city gathers aspects from above and below. Find middle, average. Gray. Mystery is a dangerous courtship. Powers to be used with care. Adopt a friendly manner. Guide conversation without threat. Say little. The few who notice will forget soon enough.

“They make up their own minds.”
