### Here no one knows me. 

Horns honk. Tires wheeze on ragged pavement. Deliveries are delivered.  Bloodshot-faced moneymakers boisterously outdo each other at the corner. Press of bodies clothed loose and tight. Snowy mist rolling in. Cold wind. Passerby clutch jackets to themselves. Keeping eyes averted.  

Invisibility is valuable. 

Invisibility in the city gathers aspects from both above and below. Some invisibility works because others wish you to be invisible. This falls apart easily, to any who pay attention. Failing adherence to certain rules transforms anyone into a deviant. From normal to frightening miscreant. Shame to be ignored or ground underfoot. 

Find middle, average. Gray. Mystery is a dangerous courtship. Powers to be used with care. Adopt a friendly manner. Guide conversation without threat. Say little. The few who notice will forget soon enough. 

They make up their own minds.
