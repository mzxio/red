### No memory of days before. 

One year past the hour of reckoning. This is reality now. The ones who remember, well, for what? Why do they hold on to a reality that no longer exists here? What good are their warnings? What values lurk in their nostalgia? 

All is as it has been forever.

“Right?”

An entire year of this and all else has been washed away. Now we live here. We follow the routines, the patterns set out for us. When the patterns move we move too. Never mind that those patterns are as artificial and arbitrary as we are. We become the shape we’re molded into, except for a few. The ones with their own mold. their own arbitrary shapes and routines. 

One year past the hour of reckoning and only a lunatic can save us.
