for centuries it was the same.
sometimes the sun was stormy or clear, for years at a time. this world would freeze or thaw at its whim, or whenever some great crack in the ground would spread earth and fire. one year the crops didn’t come in and countless died. over generations the ice receded. the creatures of the snow moved or died or changed. all these forces worked in concert. the air, the ground, the sky. but we were here and we thought we deserved more. we thought we’d been given dominion over this world and its creatures. all our legends put us at the apex of history, of nature. no one told us that we were just one type of beings among other beings, at least no one we were listening to. we were the greatest, the chosen few coming to enact god’s will upon the earth. so when we did something truly extraordinary and killed our mother no one was much surprised.
