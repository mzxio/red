### “Once you leave you can never come back.”

Never going back to what it was. Even if you never leave, there’s no going back. Only keeping a dying world alive in my memory. Cut flowers, snipped off from real life, only given a little extra time. 

“What’s already here, just hidden? So much.”

Every morning, this place. What do you do when you have no time? When you have only a little you can say to encompass something so big?

Sitting on a park bench, writing the words hastily but quietly. They were checking me out. Not my neighborhood. Write a page, threw it out, write another. Fold the words and slip them into the hiding place. 

“How long will it be?”
