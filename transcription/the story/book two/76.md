revolutions are fought with ideas first. when we were in the resistance we had to always be watching ourselves and everyone around us. don’t gather in groups of more than three for long, and even three in public can raise suspicion. don’t write on paper when meeting. they know we write messages to each other so if you must write in public, do so alone. take notes of inconsequential things to throw distraction if necessary. monitor everyone you know when they are close to you. listen to conversation and take note of minor details. the most casual aside may hold a key to their true loyalty. allegiances shift quickly. never assume anyone is on your side indefinitely. above all, be careful how you spend money. investments are the easiest way to get caught, or to expose others to danger. beware generosity, anyone else’s or your own. it may seem hypocritical to fight for freedom with such paranoia, but remember revolutions are fought first with ideas. you must treat them like any weapon. keep them safe. and consider anyone who has them as armed.
