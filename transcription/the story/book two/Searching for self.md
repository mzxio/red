### Searching for self.

Atomic life. Society can’t withstand a void. Inventing new rituals, using old ideas to start. Oral history is easy to devour and replace. Eat it up so no one knows anything different from what you say. Only a few will remember the old ways. They won’t be convinced. 

“What happened?” 

Tell them whatever you want to tell them. Make sure the answers are forbidden and destroyed, so that they cease to exist. Those who ask, who wonder, who live in fear, they will be pushed to the edges. If they keep asking, outcast them from your society. Let your population self-select. Your followers and believers will group together, stand against the ones outside.

Give your tribe reasons to be afraid of everyone else. Hurt them secretly so you can help them publicly. Buy their loyalty. Invent some mysteries to let them in on. They will be eagerly complicit. They will police themselves. They will build defenses for you.

Keep them listening and believing and you win.

“They’re at the gate.”
