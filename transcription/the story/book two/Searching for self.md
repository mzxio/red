### Searching for self. 

Society can’t withstand a void. Atomic life. Inventing new rituals, using old ideas to start. Oral history is easy to devour and replace. Eat it up so no one knows anything different from what you say. Only a few will remember the old ways. They won’t be convinced. 

“What happened?” 

Tell them whatever you want to tell them. If they keep asking, outcast them from your society. Make sure their answers are forbidden and destroyed, so that they cease to exist. Those who ask, who wonder, who live in fear, they will be pushed to the edges. Let your population self-select. Your followers and believers will group together. 

Tell your tribe to be afraid of everyone else. They will build defenses for you. Invent some mysteries to let them in on. They will be eagerly complicit. Hurt them secretly so you can help them publicly. Buy their loyalty. They will police themselves.

Keep them listening and believing and you win.

“They’re at the gate.”
