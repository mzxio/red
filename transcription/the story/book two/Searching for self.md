### Searching for self.

Society can’t withstand a void. Atomic life. New rituals using old ideas. Easy to devour and replace oral history. Eat it up so no one knows anything different from what you say.

Only a few will remember the old ways. They won’t be convinced. 

“What happened?” 

Tell them whatever you want to tell them. Forbid and destroy the answers so they cease to exist. Let your population self-select. They will police themselves.  Those who ask, who wonder, who live in fear, they will be pushed to the edges by those who believe. When the unbelievers keep asking, outcast them from your society. Your followers and believers will group together, standing against the ones outside.

 Give your tribe reasons to be afraid of everyone else. Hurt them secretly so you can help them publicly. Buy their loyalty. Invent titillating mysteries to let them in on. They will be eagerly complicit. They will build monuments for you.

Keep them listening and believing and you win.

“They’re at the gate.”
