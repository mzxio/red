### No patience, gluttonous.

Filling empty spaces with unfulfilling things, then chasing even more. 

“Wait, think, then act.”

Stand away. Evaluate value and risk, cause and effect. Leave with only the consequences. Nothing to do but consume less. Be patient. Reaction is what all objects do, introspection is something that thinking beings can undertake. 

“Stop fucking consuming.”

“There’s no filling the holes, just makes new ones that have to be filled later on.”
