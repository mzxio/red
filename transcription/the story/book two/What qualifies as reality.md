### What qualifies as reality?

Is it a common understanding, shared perceptions? Does something cease being real when not everyone agrees that it exists? Or does it exist without consensus? What if it is seen by one but not by anyone else? Then does it cease to be real? Can we tell anyone what is real or not?

“There’s no way to tell what’s real and what’s illusion.”

“In dreams there can be ways, but in waking? What is real?”

What are the qualifications for a reality-seer? Are there ways to determine if someone is more susceptible to reality than others? If we go to all this effort to decide what is one and what is the other, what difference does it make? Real is not always consensus. Real is not always measurable. 

“Does it matter, then, what is reality and what is illusion?”
