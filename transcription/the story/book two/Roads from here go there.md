### Roads from here go there.

None of this world is truly disconnected. Rails of blood and bones. If I knew the right turns on the road, I could find you. Would you take me if I found you?

Nature makes deserts, people make wastelands. The desolation is ours. We make the disconnection. We weren’t listening when they told us. We went our own way. 

Weight of yesterday, today, tomorrow. Today weighs heaviest, it’s the only place you can do anything about anything. Tomorrow weighs more than yesterday, there’s more at stake.
