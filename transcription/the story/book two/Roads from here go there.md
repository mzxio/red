### Roads from here go there.

None of this world is truly disconnected. Rails of blood and bones. If I knew the right turns on the road, I could find you. 

“Would you take me if I found you?”

The desolation is ours. We made the disconnection. We weren’t listening when they told us. We went our own way. 

“Nature makes deserts, people make wastelands.” 

Weight of yesterday, today, tomorrow. Today weighs heaviest, it’s the only place you can do anything about anything. Tomorrow weighs more than yesterday, there’s more at stake.
