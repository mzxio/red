### How did it come to this?

“Swift river currents.”

Seventeen past the hour, five minutes late. Waiting  for the train. Everyone else is waiting too. More every minute. Crowding in. Nothing to do but wait. I’ll walk instead.

Clouds scuttle overhead while we make and lose our fortunes. Rattle and roll the bones. In our self-importance we have no idea how tiny and fleeting we are. Spirits vying for a seat in heaven, ghosts jockeying for immortality.

“The dead come back to life.”
