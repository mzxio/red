### They measured us by how much money we’d give them.

Lifetime value, that’s what they called it. That was our worth to them. Our usefulness, their savvy. Anything to increase their earnings through new products and services, capture and retention. If we were high value we were worth supporting, worth listening to.

If we were low value we were irrelevant, disposable. If we approached our estimated limit we could be discarded. They always made their money, so our continued patronage was no longer necessary. We were no longer necessary. Once we were no longer a customer, unless there was a chance we might become a customer again, our value dropped to zero.

That’s how they saw the world. How they saw people. Maybe some of them thought it was a problem to think and act that way, but mostly they wanted to do it more. Bigger. When it all went wrong they wished they’d taken more.
