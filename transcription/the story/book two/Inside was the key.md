### Inside was the key.

Both versions of reality. The one that was, the one that is. What became and what could have been.

“I know what I chose, because it’s what I always chose. No changing it.”

Lock down the other reality. Even only as a relic it is dangerous. As long as it exists there is risk. What is, is. What isn’t should not be. Keep it hidden. The fewer who know the better. Better no one ever knows. Destroy it when you have a chance.

“If this gets loose it could change everything.”
