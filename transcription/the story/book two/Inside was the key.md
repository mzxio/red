### Inside was the key.

Both versions of reality. The one that was, the one that is. What became and what could have been. 

I know what I chose, because it’s what I always chose. No changing it. 

Lock down the other reality. Destroy it when you have a chance. As long as it exists there is a risk of contamination. What is, is. What isn’t should not be. Leave it only as a relic of another universe. Even then it is dangerous. Keep it hidden. The fewer who know the better. Better no one ever knows. 

“If this gets loose it could change everything.”
