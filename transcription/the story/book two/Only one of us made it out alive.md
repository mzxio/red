“Nothing happened the way it was supposed to.”

The snow came down. Slow at first, thicker and heavier, then blowing whiteout. Rushing like star trails in the lights at night.

Reality has a coarse shape. Not smooth, not to be tamed by some mortal being’s plans. He was right, nothing went according to plan. All our ideas, fantasies, careful preparation. All wrong. All unprepared. 

It felt right when it all went wrong. Like that’s what was coming all along.

We all knew it, even though we claimed not to know the future. The future was always there. The shape of things to come is always written in the shapes of what is. 

“Not that it makes it any easier.”

All I could think in the moment before I died was _this isn’t the last time_.
