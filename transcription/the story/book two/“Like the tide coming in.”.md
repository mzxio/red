### “Like the tide coming in.”

Long nights up until late. Looking for something. I was looking for understanding. I understood so little. Finding it was my priority. You had other priorities. They all did. Everyone I met in those days, touched, talk to. Transparency of self, opacity of other. Fog of war. Every day that’s true. We see what we see. 

I wonder what you saw in me. 

“We all have our motives.”
