### Time holds many stories. 

Before the beginning there was no thing. Yet even then the story was told.

Our stories are the stories of the universe. We are all in the story. We can never be erased, but our stories may be forgotten when there is no one left to tell them. 

Tell old stories. Make new stories. Cast your stories into the void. 

The universe begins.
