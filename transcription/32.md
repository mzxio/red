waking up in an old familiar place. that word, _familiar_. can a place be family? what constitutes family? family isnâ€™t always familiar, but familiar can be seen like family. is it the shared experience? what does it take to be family? is it when the familiarity is reciprocated? does there have to be mutual love and respect? does family have to be people, or can it be places or things? we are all still earth stuff, star stuff. can family be family if it can never speak your name but love all the same? the way i have loved cities, can the city love me back? the way i can take my home with me, live a gypsy life, is the car my family? whose family am i?
