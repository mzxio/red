did you mean what you said? you said a hateful thing and said you didn’t hate. before you’d asked a question and answered it with your own actions. did you even know? not that i can ever know. what could have been is gone, what’s left is broken beyond repair. even the infinity after this is no comfort. this was you, your choice, your doing. i didn’t help at all either. but when you were alone with that girl, when you killed her as you claim you did,  that was your choice. that is hateful too. don’t act with hatefulness and then disavow hate. own that as you would anything else. or maybe when you killed her you lost the ability to see that way. maybe you killed everything i loved in you. maybe you killed me too.

“you exist here,” they said. “it’s not linear.”
“no, it’s not linear,” he said. $￼

it was so cold that night. the full moon at the shore. when you held my hand.
