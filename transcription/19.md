this atomic life, searching for self. society couldn’t withstand existentialism(;) invented rituals, use(d) the old ones to start. oral history is easy to devour, eat up all the old and no one new will be able to challenge you or the culture you build. some will wonder, what happened? those are easy, just tell them whatever story you prepared at the beginning, or really whatever story you want. if they keep asking, no really, what happened? when they sense that something is fundamentally wrong, just outcast them from your society. it’s easier than the old way of kicking people out, you don’t have to build walls. the culture will do that for you. just make those answers so forbidden that they cease to exist. let the population self-select. those who ask, who wonder, who fear will be pushed  to one side and those who follow and believe will migrate to the center. tell those people to be afraid of the others. invent some secrets to let them in on. hurt them secretly so you can help them publicly. buy their loyalty. they will police the others. keep them listening, believing, and you win.

“they’re at the gate.”
