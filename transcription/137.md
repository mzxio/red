who says we deserve to live? what does that mean -- to be deserving of life? of survival? perhaps we are god’s children, but whose god is that? ours? we are the children of our own mythology. while the titans battle it out on their mountain with the spirits of the hills or whatever pastiche of oral history made it through the ages, what does that say for the children of those stories? we deserve to live because we deserve it? because we say we do? while destroying, pillaging, raping, murdering, stealing. but choose life above all. and somewhere in our bones when know it’s true. we are children of the divine. our parent is the cosmos. we are it, we are thoughtless matter rendered thoughtful. so we know what makes us special, important. but more important than other thoughtful matter? more important than the exquisite art that nature creates? if we do indeed deserve to live, do we deserve to kill others to make that life? is any life worth that much?
