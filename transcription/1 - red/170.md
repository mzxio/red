“nothing is stopping us.”

the topography of ruin. there’s an old story, about a farmer. told and retold through the ages. who knows if there ever was a farmer. it’s difficult to search time for each other, so maybe he’s still out there. the story says that the farmer lived on the border with another tribe. they were at peace, but it was not always so. the farmer kept horses. one day his best mare jumped the stable fence and escaped. people offered their sympathy. the farmer didn’t seem to care. one day she came back, pregnant by a stallion from the neighboring tribe. so the tribe of the farmer came and congratulated him for getting three horses including the mare returned. he didn’t seem to care. one day the farmer’s son broke his leg working with the new stallion. again the farmer didn’t care. finally war came again between the tribes and all the men were called up to fight. because the farmer’s son had a broken leg, he didn’t have to fight. the story ends there but i wonder what happened next. did the farmer ever care?
