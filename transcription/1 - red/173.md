you didn’t think anyone would notice or care, did you? at least anyone who could do anything about it? the ones who notice aren’t the ones who can change, at least not alone. the ones who can move mountains by themselves, they don’t see things the same. to them we become as different species, one greater, one lesser. they might kill us like we might kill a pest. a means to an end when they require numbers or labors, or great works. they might order the mountain moved by themselves, but who do you think did the actual moving? who among you had the power to invoke change? so you can try to get them to notice, to want to do anything, and it might work... you could get them to use their power for your benefit. or you can get ten thousand pairs of eyes and hands rallied to your cause, to see what you see, to care as you care. then the mountain movers can do their work, animated by their own beliefs. then, maybe you can see something done about what you care for.
