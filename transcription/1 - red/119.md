time travel doesn’t require a body. it is possible to leave a body, go elsewhere, and then return. usually some time will have elapsed for the body in your absence. one-to-one travel is easiest but however long you were gone is also the amount of time elapsed for your body on your return. it’s possible to miss a lot as your body can carry on like you were never gone. ten-to-one at least is a better ratio to attain, so for every hour of your absence only a few minutes has elapsed. much harder to reach that level of mastery over this form of travel. and another thing: don’t trust any landmarks. the universe is constantly in motion and humans are entropy generators. the mountains and valleys can be relied upon to a point, but even they are not fixed. just as in dreams, words will rearrange themselves. after travel you may find the meaning of words has changed. in all these cases it is difficult and limiting to always approach the world as if it is brand new to you, but overall it is best not to make assumptions about where you are.
