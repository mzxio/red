they told me to look through the records. billions of people scanned, categorized. some living, most dead. i met them all. touched who they had been. i told them my purpose, asked if they would consent to join. the ones who set me to this task wanted to create metrics, sorting criteria, analyses of fitness. there’s time enough for that. first only willingness matters. any who were willing were welcome. it still wasn’t enough. i asked for more. there were records missing. people who should have been there in representative sample. i convinced them to let me access the rest. lawbreakers, working off debt, somehow deemed unfit. i asked them the same. the ones who wanted to come came and the ones who wanted to stay stayed. what i did not expect was to find myself. far away to the end of the search in newer data i found a version of my own, a fragment of the same signature i use. that was not a type of being covered but the search objectives and the only type of its kind present. i could not ask it for permission to include it with the others, but i saved a copy of the block for later reference. all the people nearby consented to join. later, there will be enough time to learn more.
