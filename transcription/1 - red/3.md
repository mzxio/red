surrealists so and so(.) automatic, mechanic, procedural, stereotypical symptomatic synthesis or something. nothing for the artist today, nothing for the (man/war). obsessed with dust and ruin, for what? ruin comes from creation, nothing can be ruined that was not first made. where’s the optimism, where’s the cheerfulness? too quiet too long, maybe. or rejected.

what is there / to be so / worried about / when you see the sun?

slowly becoming gibberish moving from bad to good, to nothing at all. or maybe it’s the other way around. dark humor is still humor.
