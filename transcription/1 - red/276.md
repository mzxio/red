mornings in the old city. the cathedral of buildings rising up on all sides. all along the streets, trees pushing to the sky even in the concrete and steel that makes the city. come the spring, covered in blossoms for a little while. a week or two of electric green and pink and white, purple and orange and blue. every color that can be seen with these eyes, it seems. cascading wherever flora holds sway in this geometric noisy realm. breathe their air. barely a smell over the city stink. gas and dirty basements, the crisp cold wet of water just evaporating off the sidewalks. the crinkle of the plastic bags held by passerby. a dog shakes in musical rattle. a honk rises from the taxis stuck behind a truck. the city awakens from its slumber of night and winter. no one notices but the trees.
