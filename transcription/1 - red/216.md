the hour of reckoning. the ground shakes, the sky burns. screams and tears from the deep. all is writhing, flaming, disintegrating mass. all that was is changed, if not gone. even as it happens, some don’t believe. some don’t understand. the innocent remain innocent. while the sinners go to meet their destiny. the reckoning. the end of the old world and the beginning of the new one. even the untouched are not unchanged. the end of all that was and the beginning of all that will be. is the new world really all that different? how bad will it be? how will we make it in the ruins? the sky is still burning and you’re only thinking about your next meal? if you survive you get to answer all those questions. if not, well, thinking was just a waste of time. the reckoning is at hand. those who die will be lost and forgotten, those who live will try to remember. do you remember? do you know what brought us here? i’m not sure if i do. i wrote these stories not really knowing what i was doing. i saw this time, the time before, the time after. if know where this story goes. or do i? the reckoning changes all.
