what are the wages of sorrow?

traveling into oblivion, is there another side? does the void end, and exist contained in non-void? or does it just go on for ever? or is there another sate, beyond void and being, a third way? void and being are so fixated on their relationship to each other, claiming dominion over all that is and isn’t, claiming all of creation as their children made up of only their two parts. are we their children made up of more than just two aspects? is there something else? and if not two, why only three? why not four? it’s easier to count these fundamentals as binary. is and isn’t, thingness and no-thing-ness. but if you walk away from being and into void, how long before you walk into something else? or does it just get darker and darker until... absolute oblivion(?)
