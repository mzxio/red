wrecks all up and down the coast. the current pulls them here. from who knows where. the old shipping lanes. far away. at least once a year. used to be more. seemed like every other week brought a new one. now there are just a few. guess most of them already came. how many still out there drifting to us? we scrapped the old ones, the ones we could get to. some there’s no getting. stuck on reefs and rocky bays, currents too strong or we wash onto the rocks just like the wrecks. not worth dying for, the salvage. now there’s not much use. the wrecks are old, stripped, rusty. not like the old ones. they’ve been adrift too long. sometimes they come already gutted, like someone got there first. there’s people who still live out on the water. in the deep sea. that’s what they say at least. i never seen a sea person. just all the old sea people’s junk. the coast littered with their refuse, leaking toxic slurry. some places on the coast have blackened and died from whatever ghost juices the corpses of the wrecks hold. they are cursed, these dead ships. spared from the conflagration, but not from the long slow death after. so they come here to rest.
