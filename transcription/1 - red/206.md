receiving signals from the deep. formless noise, then modulations. pulses and tones. regular. a long pause, a low baseline drone, then rough harmonies of mathematically precise tones. almost wet and bubbling like a stream, uneven if not for its precision. how many tones followed by how much silence? then repeats. again and again. communicating something. to someone somewhere, it means something. nothing to me. just tones. just sounds. maybe i’ve heard those sounds before? they make me feel a certain way. a deep fear. something is wrong and they represent that wrongness. that’s all though, nothing more. it says something is wrong but not a warning. just an alarm. made to be heard even far away, made to be alarming. thus its uneven timbre, its repetition, its volume. what is happening? should i do anything to prepare? is it even meant for me here? it could be an alarm somewhere else, its signal propagated and bounced until arriving here, far from its original purpose. it goes on and on for a while, maybe a half an hour. the tones, the silence, again. eventually i don’t hear it any more. did i miss something important?
