the thing is not the thing. when you talk about the thing, you must talk about it as if it’s something else. talking about the thing diminishes its power up until the opposite. too soon and the thing becomes diffuse, compromised. too late and the thing has its own life, it no longer belongs to you. talk about its essence, thingness. eventually it won’t be yours so talk about it while you can. or don’t. don’t talk about thing or thingness. wait. wait forever if you have to. take it to your grave, take it to another universe. where did the thing come from, anyway? it may not be of this domain. maybe it doesn’t belong here. or maybe its alienness is precisely the point. it is here because it has not been here before. not as it is now. maybe it visited when it was younger, or it will return to retire here. maybe thing has traveled far and wide in order to come to you. still the thing is not the thing. the spirit is not the body. what it becomes and what it is or what could be all different things. that is why you must shelter it while it’s weak, and let it go when it’s no longer yours.
