on the old system it was the most you could have. there was no count higher. all in a row, starting at zero. “you don’t have technology this advanced without a zero, it’s a math thing.” that’s what she said. and she was right, we needed zero. nothing really worked right without it. and it took so long! to have a thing was to count it. not having meant not counting. but zero took a while to understand. counting the absence. in the space where there can be something, say there is nothing. make room for nothing. count nothing. all your counting is one too high, because you started counting too late. zero is here. so the numbers may seem odd, unusual, not right. even though they are. give the numbers to the counting machines. they will make it work even when you can’t. they know the absence the way you don’t. you’ll count things like sticks in the sand, they will count the distance to the stars. you’ll rise out of dirt and create infinite realms.
