send them to a neutral context. add seasons, inputs. measure their responses. with enough stimulation they may begin to communicate. separate them and wait to see if they look for each other. give them choices about physical appearance and personality. see what they choose to be and seem. if they still won’t communicate, let them choose an avatar and leave them together for a while. no combination of stimulus may be enough. they may need more time. time is something that we still have plenty of. let them be together. they came this far, they mat need to go a little farther. take them away from the fight, away from where they’ll be vulnerable to attack. even if they bring the fight with them, make sure they know they don’t have to fight. appoint a guardian to stand by and intervene in case of agitation. they don’t feel safe. they need to feel safe. maybe eventually something will work and they will start to talk.
