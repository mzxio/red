for more than 500 years our last confederation stood. the ancient lands we’d walked and lived for millennia, ever since we first got here. since time before time, only in the oldest legends were we from anywhere but here. where was here? we forgot. their stories don’t tell about us, just how we were easy to control, easy to dominate. their stories are the stories of how they defeated us, killed us, locked us up and made us leave our homes. they make sure we are implicated in our own destruction. if only we’d just made it easy for them, just died when they came. that would have been so much better for them. that’s what they want you to know. they were the strong ones and the weak should accept their place and disappear. we were never weak. theirs was the strength of arms, of numbers. they overwhelmed us. now i can’t bear the thought of going back, finding our old lands. i know it is changed utterly. there will be almost no trace of us. they have washed away all but a few of our stories. they replaced us with other people who could do their labor, and then abandoned them when the labor was no longer required. so it goes with these people. always taking. destroying.
