nowhere, now here. nothing but here, no matter what here is. no thing. absence of things. void. nothing nowhere, infinity of oblivion. unbounded, undirected, any direction is the same as all direction. no frame to say where here ends and there starts. it’s all here, nowhere. traveling into nothing means taking something in, shattering the slow quiet dark. even information taints the flawless void, carrying its memories and stories through nowhere to somewhere. the true void must exist apart, held by those opposing forces of nothingness -- somethingness. a bubble carefully crafted in the mind of the creator, held in stasis and equilibrium. there is so much nothing in every something, clearing away all the things, all the heres, takes discipline. for as long as we have stories we have told of the practitioners of nothing. the ones who study the balance between thingness and nothingness, who labor to hold unreconcilable values together as one. even the names of their religions and practices compromise their practice. to name a thing to separate it, to bring it of the void. “nameless: the origin of heaven and earth. naming: the mother of ten thousand things.” $
