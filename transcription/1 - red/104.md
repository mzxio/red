# 104

it was raining in the city by midnight. the park was mostly empty, except for us. standing at the water, sharing a flask, watching the wet misty glow of the city rise to meet the clouds. walking uptown, looking for a place to eat. soggy and leaden, no way to get a light, no way to see. just blurry and stumbling until there, a sparkling sign, the smell of chopped meat and onions, the piercing strike of metal against metal, fragrant steam mixing with the stink. then time to go, to find a cab, to shiver in the back seat. taking the (-79th street-) transverse, the bridge between dimensions. black-white-black-white-black. accelerating, chasing, tearing through the night. TRIP IN PROGRESS says the display. ripping out a loose thread, feeling it all start to unravel. swimming from the drink, from the anticipation. sweating and dripping, then screaming back into the night on the other side, one step closer to the end. flipping the page to the next chapter, the last chapter. dragged through time and space for one last encounter, one long tense chilly argument, one more lie, one more truth, one more night. all my universe collapsed on itself and only i can carry it into the next day, but first the waiting through one last rainy city night for the sunrise.
