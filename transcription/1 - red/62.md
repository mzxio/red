#62

late for the train, missed appointments, considerations. snubbed, spurned, ignored. the train pulls out, carrying its unusual cargo. we are together finally. she makes me go down on her extra long to make up for the snubbing. awake. pale walls, strange place. not home, not now, not then, not later, nowhere. the tunnel collapses. jump into a different dimension. far away. no trains, no nights or days. just daze. her memory fades, falling back into me. it’s we again, carrying more than one inside the shell of one. time flashes and slides, unconnected to anything seen or sensed. slipping in fits and starts, uneven, unpredictable. falling, falling, faster into nothing. awaken. another place, another unknown. “a pickle shifts uneasily under the bun.” $￼
