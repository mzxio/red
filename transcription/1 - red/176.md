# 176

there was something in the ground that made it burn. the ship came down in a valley with some kind of frozen lakes. methane maybe? what would combust in this environment(?) never mind. this place is weird, not exactly consistent. doesn’t matter much anyway. nothing can be salvaged from that mess while it burns. maybe something got thrown free but most of the ship came down in one piece. the drive section crushed the midship. a few pods were thrown free. i wonder how long this valley will be burning. if eventually that whole thing will go up. best be far away if that happens. not that it will matter much. with supplies from the command module i’ll last a week or two at most. no one will hear my signal out there. same thing that let them jump me, whoever it was. the sun’s putting out too much radiation. the wrong kind. i doubt anyone’s living here. so i guess this is it. my new home. my last home. might as well go down to the wreck and see what can be salvaged. not like i got anything better to do.
