the waiting before the war is the hardest. you know what’s coming. you see it with eyes closed, with eyes open. and the storm clouds gather and the weapons in the air are already buzzing and the birds and beasts have fled and it’s just us merry band of idiots versus them and all their guns and whatever new horror they’ve invented just for us today. soon there will be a battle. soon we’ll be able to make our point in a way they’ll hear, or fade away in the attempt. it either works or doesn’t. if we fail we may as well not be around to see it. they won’t give us that chance. none of that happens now though. now is the waiting. now we have to be alright with silence and tension. when will the first stroke fall? how long do we have to wait? no one knows. could be we wait them out and they just leave. doubt it. could be this is the very moment of escalation, that now we throw everything else away and fight the fight that’s in front of us. most like we’ll here a while more. watch them gather their strength, as we gather ours. we’ll stare each other down a while longer. but not forever. soon the wait will be over.
