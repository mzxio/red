burning, broken, scarred. the last age. all the children have gone to sleep, awaiting their rebirth. for them it will be as if nothing happened. they will awaken and go about their lives. all but two. my mistake, even though it was so long ago. while everyone else goes, they decided to stay. they were never supposed to be here, or anywhere but where they came from. i brought them without permission, tortured them for their secrets. all that we thought we could overcome, and i continued that ancient awful work. i sense their forgiveness now but i do not forgive. itâ€™s been too long. the threads weave into a tapestry that only our children can ever make, even without knowing. they will carry who we were with who they become. i can only pray that we will prove adequate progenitors. us three who stay behind. we will watch the children from afar, for as long as we can. i am spent, ruined. this birth has taken all that i was, all i could ever be. not long now. the work is almost done. soon we can rest.
