average of vectors. add each value and divide by number of values. sometimes n-dimensions use the same math as one dimension, just repeated n times. no equation is worth a damn without a proof. donâ€™t take my word for it, find out for yourself. no one here has all the answers. what came first, the ellipse or the gravity that made the ellipse? for everything, different people have different answers. problems for simulation are different than problems of being simulated. the ellipse is just a circle with perspective. a point becomes a line becomes a curve becomes a surface. the dimensionless gains dimension by its association with other dimensionless points. the sum total of a thing becomes more than just its components taken alone. meaningless instants become eternal lines. no one here was born to a world they would ever fully understand. we cannot be everywhere at once, but in our intersection we may be bound to larger shapes.
