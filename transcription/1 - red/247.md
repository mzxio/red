this place used to be a sea. dry before that, like it is now. probably a sea again before long. before long for mother, maybe generations of us. walk the plains while you can. so flat and almost smooth, worn down by the floods and the grinding of the sea that was. little cuts of rivers, running between the ancient hills. some farm this land now. it’s good for cultivation. all those countless ages of sea life, dying and falling to the ground, how many generations of their corpses collected, compressed, buried? now we till the ground with their bodies, now almost unrecognizable. they break down even more. the crops come in and the farmer takes them to market. we’ll eat the last thing that remembers the bones of these ancient creatures, the seeds grown from the plants that dug deep and consumed the bones. maybe the plains will flood and the farmer’s bones will go into the soil there to join those old dead, and be buried by new ones. how many times does the cycle repeat?
