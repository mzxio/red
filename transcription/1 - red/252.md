hollow buildings, remembering  what we forgot. the old city as it was. the bricks are harder than we are. they stand longer than us. we walk back and forth in front of the doors, pausing at the stoop to fix something, adjust, light up, make a call. from the stoopâ€™s eye view you have to stop for a long time for it to see you as anything but a blur, to make a sound more than the ever flowing rhythm of footsteps on the sidewalk. the hood kids know, they sit on the stoops for years. the brick and concrete would love, if they could love, anyone who sits with them thus. they soften and smooth with more touch, so maybe that is a kind of love. harmony of living and not living, between people and their shelters. not so strange, a warmth and gentleness of home. familiarity with the old stones. they remember. home knows you as well as you know it. maybe even better.
