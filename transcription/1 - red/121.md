all these obsessions. do they really make life better? passing fancies, fleeting adoration for things bought and sold or just invested in. time. time spent. and that’s why it seems like life, like what else would we do here at this moment in history but indulge in the obsession? games and sports, music, movies. entertainment industrialism writ large. as if all our labors are just focused on feeding these obsessions. make real money to spend it on virtual rewards. consumables that aren’t really created or destroyed, just synthesized and discarded. to electrons do they return, from electrons were they summoned. just like our money. even currency becomes virtual. the obsessions seem so wasteful but what else is there for us right now? why would we go outside where nothing belongs to us? not the earth, not the sky, not the fruits of our labor? everything is bought and paid for. most of us are prisoners of one sort or another, in cages of steel or cages of entertainment. don’t you want to have fun? fun will happen when it benefits the man.
