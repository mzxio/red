the obsession with the woods. building to scale, what scale? dimensions, angles, loads, parts, money, time, all of it. every tiny detail. positioned just so, and how deep? how tall, how wide? how much room to sleep, to sit, to eat? for one, for two, for four? does it rest on the ground, does it float in the trees? how long will it take to build? will it ever really be finished, or just go along for ever and eventually lapse into a quiet stasis?
