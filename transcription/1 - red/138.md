there’s no way to tell what’s real and what’s illusion.

in dreams maybe, there can be ways. but in waking, what is real? what qualifies as reality? is it the common understanding, shared perceptions? then does something cease being real when not everyone agrees that it exists? or does it exist without consensus? what if it is seen by one but not by anyone else? then does it cease to be real? can we tell anyone what is real or not? what are the qualifications for a reality-seer? are there ways to determine if someone is more prone to reality than not? and if we go to all this effort to decide what is one and what is the other, what difference does it make? real is not always consensus, real is not always measurable. does it matter then what is reality and what is illusion?
