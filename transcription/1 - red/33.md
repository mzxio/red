lining up for one last chance at life. they waited ten, fifty, a hundred deep. until they said “no more gas” and no amount of cursing or threats would bring any more. where could they go next? “you don’t have to go home,” he said, “but you can’t stay here.” sweltering in the desert or shivering in the city after closing time, no difference. same desperation, same yearning, same fear. back of the line is first to die. and if you were polite and let someone in front of you, will they turn back to help, to return the favor? maybe. i don’t think so. maybe that’s why there’s so much callous selfishness, fear of being last. of being first to die. i wonder though... how many turn around and help?
