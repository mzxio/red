only a monument remained to the way things were before. the old rules etched in stone, the epitaph of a forgotten empire. from this spot you can see all they ruled for miles around. a single chief given many tribes. the great consensus-finder, builder of walls and roofs, planter of the first harvest, offspring of the great. read the laws upon the stone. the chief was cruel, with a vicious justice. burned as many houses as built. another stone on the road of empire, the devastation of souls. no one here remembers, no one here is left. their lands are dead now, abandoned. all these places with their ruins, their memory. cut off, only the bones are left. still the monument stands. for another thousand years if no one disturbs it. leave the past where it is. let the land erase our memories in its own time. the cycle of empire rises and collapses again and again. the people donâ€™t much change. only the land remains, waiting and knowing.
