dreams of friends, dreams of enemies, dreams of people yet to be. scenes in forests, bedrooms, long hallways and glass buildings. the shadow of towers falls across the woods. we walk under the trees. you ask me questions. i tell you stories. i wake and i want to talk to you but there is no way. only in dreams. we move from scene to scene, across the old bridge and the empty playground, the pine needles and dusty buildings. not my stories to tell but you want to hear them anyway. our voices ring off the trees. forever doesn’t seem so long. later watching silently, a woman takes a man into her (hands?) and gets him to tell her everything she wants to know. some interrogation infiltration, he won’t know anything until it’s too late. she is a professional, an expert at her craft. one agent of many, a specialist. like all my crew i am proud of her ability to advance the mission. only the best. fool will never know what he was a part of, what opportunities he missed, even in the dream lands. there always has to be a pansy, someone to take the fall.
