tying knots. ghosts in the bathroom. infinite regret. wonder what (blank) is doing now. why would it be any other way? same thing that keeps anything else from happening. roll up. bathrooms are clean. play it forward. crumble. not all at once. a slow change. good becomes just ok. ok becomes bad. ruins by the highway. someone from the old world knows they’ll share the same fate. pull one piece out and the entire thing comes down. twenty thousand miles to the next services. the tank won’t hold that much gas. you’ll have to walk the rest of the way. what is gas anyway? only a century’s obsession. soon it will be something else. and the bones of the truckstops will bleach in the desert sun and the wind will blow the ghosts out to sea. no palace here for any of us. no one but the ones we lost. the ones we left. the ones we’ll never see again.
