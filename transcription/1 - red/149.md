he asked for a tissue. i gave one to him. “if you could look inside the hypercube,” he said, “you’d be able to prepare for stuff like that.” i didn’t tell him that i had looked into the future and seen his exact need, but i’d never heard it called “the hypercube” before. like some platonic four dimensional ideal, and through its edges or perhaps reflected in its facets, the future could be revealed. i never much cared for the geometry of the fourth dimension. the hypercube is a crude invention of three dimensions, made to explain the unfamiliar in familiar terms. the hypercube is a child’s play thing. also a shaman’s mandala. its contemplation may yield some insight at the right time, for the right questions. I’ve never seen one in nature. it is purely abstraction. like crystal ball, another platonic ideal given fourth dimensional treatment. those at lest i have seen , but eventually are a distraction from their true purpose. we are time travelers. we already see the future. but sometimes it’s easier to remove distraction and focus on a thing.
