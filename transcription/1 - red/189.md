i decided to stay. the pod says ‘remote system online’ but what does that mean? where will i go? should i just leave my body here? i thought i’d go, just get it over with. i let the pod scan me. it said it was ready to perform the procedure. then i wondered about the air. how long have i been down here? a week of days, a day that feels like a week? still the air is fresh down here. recirculated. i found the tanks. the scrubbers. looks like i could be here for a hundred years or more, unless something fails. whoever built this place, they built it to last. there’s food i can eat down here too, and water. the dome is still broken so i have to suit up to go topside. i wonder if there’s any way to repair the dome. maybe there’s more equipment on a level i haven’t explored yet. whoever it was must have had a way to do maintenance. i’ll send my copy on ahead. maybe it will find someone on the other end. they could come get me. just as likely there’s nothing and i’m sending myself to die. worth a try. while i wait there’s no reason not to look at the lower levels again.
