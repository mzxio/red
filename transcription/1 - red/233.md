the screwup, the ne’er do well, the drunk in the gutter. that’s me. when they found me they thought i was so clever, so insightful. they said they liked what i had to say, what i wrote, the way i folded laundry. but they didn’t know, the screwup will always find a way to fail. keep your expectations low when the screwup comes to town. big ideas, big promises, big words. these are all easy. take it from me, it’s not gonna work. whatever the promise, whatever the idea. there’ll be a reason. maybe even a good one. it’ll all just fall apart. and maybe the screwup will run away, or maybe you will. maybe there’ll be some piece left over, some ruins of a half-built life. burn them down if you want, or just leave them where they are. they were never going to amount to anything. the screwup is a confidence trickster, listening, watching. it’s like they can read your mind, scratch out your innermost thoughts and desires. the most dangerous one is the gentle one, the one you’d never suspect. even acting shady, they’ll give you reasons to believe. the screwup is a failed con artist because they con themselves. it’s not just you. they make themselves believe, so they can make you believe too. so spare a thought for the drunk in the gutter. didn’t have to be this way.
