tamping down the dreams so visions stop. no more screaming from the beyond, wild heaven’s whispers. what is madness? seeing things that aren’t there? how do we really know what is and what isn’t? can you tell? is reality what you perceive with your senses, what you can measure with tools or instruments? who made these tools, and what are they specialized in? we see so little, can we really trust our eyes? our sense of things comes from no single sense, rather is built up from all data poured into it by all our senses, even the ones that cannot be measured. am i insane? what is the difference between vision and delusion? is a delusion always false, something that never comes true? is a vision something that must be true in order to avoid becoming delusional? what if a thing could be true but never comes to pass for some other reason? is a vision of what could have been a delusion or just reality somewhere else that isn’t here? in a multiverse, are all delusions really happening somewhere all the time?
