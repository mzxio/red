four walls. one is broken. two hundred and seventeen days ago i started writing. every morning. so far, without fail. i wrote because almost every night at a certain time, in the dark, i would feel lost and bereft. like i had failed to do an important thing. create. all i would want in those dark places was to make something. to write. but by then it’s late and i’m probably drunk and there just isn’t enough time in the day to go back and make something. if it’s time for sleep, that is not the time to create. sometimes i would forego the sleep. i would push through the booze and weed and sadness and try. it rarely worked. all those writings, maybe some were passable. i don’t know if any were good. so instead i resolved to start my day with this act of creation. that even if nothing else happens on a day i can sleep easy knowing i put words to a page. that i made something. then destiny has a way of thumbing its nose and laughing at me. my hour of reckoning came precisely when predicted. four dimensions. one is broken. i can’t see it all but i see enough.
