the last human in the sim. when everyone else has moved on, died their unnatural consequences, been reborn elsewhere, one remains behind. the end of the sim comes cold and quiet and sudden but she waits all the same. walks the empty sidewalks in the city. looks out over the finite ocean. it ends somewhere, over there just beyond the horizon. we donâ€™t go there any more. she sits in the empty restaurants, the quiet shop. no one comes here any more. the food in the market never goes stale. those processes are suspended. little by little all the normal pieces fall away. the unreality of the sim takes their place. the cycles still run, the animus. wild life, sun and moon and stars. dust seems to stop falling and the air is eternally, meticulously, unnaturally clear. she is not alone. some other beings still dwell here. just no other humans. in the desolate city they somehow always run into each other, convenient excuses. the last passengers on a sinking ship. waiting for the last flood. the shutdown. the end.
