we are, none of us, innocent. when does a child stop being innocent? or are we born with the weight of sin? they say we were released from that ancient burden, but is that really so? nothing much seems to have changed since then. the stakes have gotten higher, the history remains. so is there ever any innocence for any of us? and if there were another who really could make that claim, what would we do to them? induct them into our corruption, if only for our own comfort? we are none of us innocent. even without knowing, we are complicit. we follow the path set before us, make up rules inside bigger rules. nothing is really new.
