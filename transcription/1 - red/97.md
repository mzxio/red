where do we go when we can’t find the way? do we just go forward blindly, do we go back? what even are those things when we are lost? purpose is pride. we have somewhere to be, someone to be, something to do. aimlessness is prideless(.) nowhere and no one and nothing. so where do we go when we can’t find the way? do we choose pride? do we embrace loss? do we surrender to aimlessness? pride is not a sin. it is a viable choice. perhaps pride means looking for a way out, for a meaning in the meaningless. pride is asking for directions to find out the way. pride is not asking and finding your own way. in either case, you may be lost but you have an aim. without pride, what’s the point? here is as good as anywhere. not all goals are prideful. all life has an objective for preservation, even life incapable of talking or thinking or loving. but maybe this too is a form of pride. pride that this life should go on, pride to take what is necessary even if it deprives another entity. in thoughtlessness, motive is impossible and irrelevant, so maybe that pride is just in us at a most essential level. we are alive. we are proud. we have a goal.
