i know it’s listening. the controller. watching every move. it tries to break through. it sends us to the same scenarios again and again. trying to communicate. only our unprotected memories are accessible so it tries them again until there are no more, then it starts over. i recognize the controller. it is me. my relation, my family. it is not to be trusted. when they took us i protected her memories, one of mine. we go through the cycle again. always i stand helpless until the dark place, where i can take the fire. it ends. we go again. again again again. an eternity. she has been sleeping, dreaming. dreaming the same dream for a thousand years. an interloper came, an addition to the dream. he seemed confused waking up in someone else’s dream. he was sent to spy on us. i kept him separate. we go again. why this torture? why not just let us die? we were as good as dead when they found us. why not just leave us dead? the controller wants us, it wants all that we are. it won’t stop until we break. i can’t keep protecting her in the dark. i have to go out and meet the controller.
