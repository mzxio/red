faults in forever. they wouldn’t listen. no stars will guide us here. there is no way, no path. no way forward. only broken stars. the ones that fell to earth, the accidental collisions predestined. every day sends out its signal, its light. after, before, all around. you feel it or you don’t, you make your own determinations. were they really your own? how many times did we come here? no one remembers. a long eternity. eternity’s not that long. every day the rain falls on the water. every day the raft rises and falls with the tide. no one remembers the way it was before. they tell stories to remind themselves, but none of it is true. there is no true. we all have a different version. how and why and who, what difference does it make? we’ll all come back around again. eventually we’ll change places. we already have. what is old, what is new?
