last day of the year. the sun rises low in the east. almost the lowest all year. we trick ourselves with our calendars. the new year starts just after the shortest day. the darkest days. long nights. at least it was where they invented the calendars. on the other side of the world these are the longest days, the brightest, the midst of summer. but they didn’t make the calendar. their people didn’t take over the world and spread their ideas to places where they made no sense. or maybe it does make sense for the year to start in the brightest days instead of the darkest. the promise of the future versus what already exists? the ancient feast days remember, they hold whatever the seasons do, wherever they are. the old forgotten spirals. washed away by whoever came and dominated this land after pushing out or killing the ones who used to be here. so everywhere the same calendar but the same discomfort too. the year sits heavily on us, the season’s moods don’t fit quite right with the days of our lives. we feel the ghosts of other days while the living days try to keep up. the calendar closes. another page begins.
