in the old stories, we stole fire from the gods. we never just made it ourselves. someone went to a high mountain or a deep cave or did some trick to wrest the fire from the hands of whoever had brought it to the world. after we steal their fire, we start killing the gods. not all at once, but slowly over the ages we kill them(.) one by one, their power becomes ours. by the time the last god lies dead, we have become as gods would be to our own eyes in the days before we carried the fire. then our children will steal the fire from us just as we did, and they too will begin to kill their gods. and so it goes, on and on until life is spent and there are no gods, no children, and the fire is all but spent. as long as we keep the fire going somewhere, life will go on too. fire carriers are life carriers, with the power of both life and death, until the children have the fire, we must go on and keep the old ways alive. it may not be enough to save us but the fire will keep us alive long enough to keep fighting, keep growing. thatâ€™s why we stole it in the first place.
