the madness of obsession. waking dreams all night. when thereâ€™s only one question, and no answers. then the questions divide like cells in some protoplasm. many questions, no more answers. then the infinite sleep, lost charting what is known, what can be known, probing the edge for weakness. a breach leaks answers. the ship of doubt begins to take on water. here the goal is to sink. to fall, to drift to the bottom of an ocean of answers. but no, the ship stays firmly afloat. in dreams the answers rarely arrive, only in waking can the walls be broken, the ocean can be swum. abandon the ship and float on the tide.
