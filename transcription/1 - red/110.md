to be a cell in some beautiful creature. to be a molecule in a flower. to be an atom in a mote of dust. to be far away from everything else and close to the source. not the center, there is no center. there is us, there is all. be a part of all but not all yourself. stay close to the source, to the land, to the sun. transform, with the death of the organism, with the seeding of the flower, with the settling of the dust. folded into the earth and over an age worked back up to the surface to be consumed by a new flower, eaten by the animal, incorporated into a new being. from bone to dust and back again. the endless cycle, repeated for however long we have in this place, until there is a new place. heaven is the infinite compression where we are all together and one, then scattered to the wind to begin again.
