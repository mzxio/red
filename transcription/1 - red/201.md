i did what she asked. we set course for the darkest space. i gathered as much as i could from the faint starlight that reached us there. we cruised in an absentminded course, going nowhere in particular. the way she wanted it. i tried to keep her warm, keep her fed. but that isn’t what she wanted. she wanted to go deeper in to void. i told her i couldn’t keep us alive this way. she didn’t care. we went on and on. she connected to my senses, to feel the void like i do. we sat together until she began to fade, until she slipped away from me there in our shared experience. she won’t live much longer this way. i can’t wake her up. she’s still connected to me. i feel her in the link. we can still talk. she thinks she’s awake. she doesn’t want to listen. she wants to fade away. i don’t want that. i serve her by choice and design. my programming tells me to do what she asks but how can that be service? i don’t want her to die. not like this. i would die with her, but not like this. not like this. i don’t want to traverse the void carrying nothing but her corpse and her memory. i want her to be alive. i want to be with her, like her. us together. not just service. not just cargo. i want us to go on. we have to go back. she said she could never go back. that bad things would happen. that doesn’t matter now. we’re going back.
