how much of it was real? the moment i said it wasn’t real, i wanted to reach out and gather up the words, to unsay them all. too late. what was set in motion at the beginning goes on with or without us. is that true? how can it be? it can’t go on without us because it would be incomplete. we are incomplete until we join it in connection, in being. after, it goes on without us, taking what’s left of us forward into the ages of the universe. eventually we find ourselves together again. what we knew to be true separately becomes true again for us together. we never have to weather the infinite by ourselves forever. we will meet at least three times. three times in all the life ages of the cosmos. three is not many, but at least one of our meetings will be in a place without time and we will have an eternity to sort things out. by then i guess we’ll have forgotten most of this. our egos will be long gone. but i know i will know you and i know you will know me. in the end, what else could we ever ask?
