it was an old town. famous but run-down. the dry scrub and forgotten old buildings, left to the wind and sun. the new buildings were cheap and already sagging. they won’t last as long. the town is dying. anyone who visits knows, but they’re most too busy gawking at the old monuments. the places made famous by whoever it was who did the things that put this place on the map, in the history book, in the dramatic retelling with that one celebrity. you know who. at the convenience store they sell autographs and memorabilia. all i asked for was a drink of water. the tourists left with their souvenirs. i asked how was business. this place of near celebrity, maybe i was too excited to talk. been a long trip, too far left to go. the wind brought me here, brought us all here. i was glad of the talk and the cold water, the shared connection. dead wood washed up on the beach somewhere, just nice to hear a friendly voice. making plans to see each other again, sometime. when you’re in my dry old town stop by my place. i’ll return the favor.
