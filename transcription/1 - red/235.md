between destiny is doing. who else is there in the survey of the edges? the homeless of no fixed address and no regular income, with whatever they can carry to wherever they can rest? moved on from all the places called civilized, whose civility is deemed wanting by passerby? the sex worker using their bodies as income, to afford whatever they can, moving through risky spaces exposed and vulnerable to attack, either by customer or self-styled saviors? who else in the retinue of marginalized? the service worker, chained to their schedule and their debts, at the mercy of unhappy strangers whose displeasure can be a death sentence? how do we measure them, on a continuum of freedom to security? to be absolutely secure is to be utterly divorced from freedom, to be free is to go without security. the most secure might fancy themselves as free because their security is deceptive, beguiling. they would further marginalize the free by depriving them of their little security. or forcing them to accept a form of “security” that only secures society but nothing else. criminalizing the homeless, the sex worker, depriving them of self-determination because they were too free. what then is security worth? who is more deserving than the free ones pushed out to the margins?
