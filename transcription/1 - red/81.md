it’s risky and dangerous, traversing trans-dimensional space. you never know what you’ll be able to take with you. even if somehow you have all your possessions with you when crossing over, some will be lost. either they aren’t permitted by some minute physical difference, were never invented, whatever. there will be loss. you may not even notice. one unstable element is memory. there’s much you’ll forget without ever realizing it. the space where the memories used to be remains, so you may perceive their absence but be frustrated at any attempt to retrieve whatever used to be there. this is a good sign that you have succeeded in traveling between universes. it’s common that nothing will look or seem all that different, which in turn may lead you to believe that you were unsuccessful. don’t be deceived. you have most likely changed universes at least once and not even known it. if there ever was a time when everything stopped making sense, when all that was familiar became foreign or frightening, when all of a sudden all the things that brought comfort instead brought confusion, you have been traveling.
