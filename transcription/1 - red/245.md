momentary obsessions. not everything comes all at once. listening to the signals, sometimes old ones arrive first or repeat more than once. some strong signals come for a moment only, then wither and fade. the ones that come again and again get picked up at last, but what order do they go in? later transmissions don’t always supersede earlier ones. do you know when they were originally sent? how long were they in transit, and from where? i’m just the receiver, i don’t know any of these things. i hear the signal, i try to write it down. i know my transcription is faulty. whatever you get from me won’t be as clear and precise as some of the things i got from the deep. easy to get distracted, to editorialize when there is nothing in need of an opinion. the messages come and go. i set up like someone with an umbrella waiting for the rain. go outside and watch the sky. maybe nothing will come, maybe today will bring a big one. can’t know unless i go outside every day to look. maybe i’m getting one right now.
