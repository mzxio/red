at the end of the world... be polite(.) but also fight back.

that feeling of destiny(.)

#12.5

fueled by drugs, booze, music, ego, whatever. that feeling, so powerful when it comes, so impossible to reconcile when it’s passed. just the alignments in this life, in this world. when coincidences happen all at once, when so much points a certain way... then soon that’s just another marker along the way. destiny just becomes reality. the certainty fades. things break. then later... the destiny feeling again. these words, these things, they’re happening now for you. for everyone is having some experience but for you it’s all connected at this moment. later they’ll have those moments too and you’ll probably miss it. but when it’s your turn, and i do so love it when it’s my turn, then i just want to pay attention and not miss anything. it’s important. like life or death important. important to remember.
