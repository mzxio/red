who are the ancient ones walking among us? gods, demigods, angels, demons, immortals, all the old names and new. the ones for whom death is a different kind of companion. not the mortal death that lives inside, but a death that never calls, never writes, never visits. a death that seems to touch everything and everyone else. who walks without death? the ones who have been here for so long, seen the ages of a society, moved on from wars and ruin. beings from a different place altogether maybe(.) disguised as a local, quietly blending in to avoid detection, fear, worship. or exactly the opposite. the old stories tell of god kings, maybe in some days they come forth and assume a public face. these days they don’t seem quite so obvious, though the readiness to accept supernatural leaders waxes and wanes with passing ages. the immortal always transcends an aspect of mortality that turns the mortal into blind followers, blind haters. and to the immortal, does the mortal seem weak and flawed or more precious? are both qualities that appear in different measure? and for the most ancient of them all, the ones that transcend even immortality, what do they see that even the rest don’t see? how does their sight and knowledge change the way they walk through this world for so long?
