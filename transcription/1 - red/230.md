whoever came here thought they were going to stay. they came correct, with enough supplies for a town. whatever made them leave, they left it all. enough for many, enough for one. and worker bots, not smart enough to hold a conversation but good help anyway. don’t have to do all the work myself. we cleared away the debris, the ruined dome. the buildings could be salvaged, mostly. work for after the new dome. weeks getting ready, now we put up a new dome one layer at a time. the bots mostly get it right. i’m not climbing up there to fix it. they do the work up high. we’ll build this dome and start on the house. garden too. they left plenty of seeds. don’t remember last thing fresh i ate. long time ago. before. the crash still wakes me up at night. i can’t remember why. the attack. who attacked? nothing here worth protecting, except the dome. if they couldn’t fix it, why would they kill for it? automated defense left behind? no way of knowing, no way to go back up and check. the uplink disconnected. no one answered my calls. whatever happened, stuck here for good now.
