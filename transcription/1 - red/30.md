sometimes we’re saying different things with the same words. like it doesn’t matter how similar we are, we come to a place where we don’t share meaning and there’s no way to start because the same flawed tools that got us there are the same tools we’d have to use to get us out. and first you have to see the problem. do you see it? i see it. in the frustration, lost meaning, arguing. you see what you see. i see what i see. do we cross the bridge together or go to different places? me, i’ll just leave. it’s too upsetting to try to talk to you when it’s like nothing we say ever reaches the other. if we are living in such different universes, did we ever want to really talk anyway?
