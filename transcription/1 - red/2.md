no patience, gluttonous(.) filling empty spaces with unfulfilling things. then chasing even more, consuming, left with only the consequences of consumption. nothing to do but be patient, consume less. evaluate cause and effect. stand away from everything and reevaluate value and risk. patience. wait, think, then act. reaction is what all objects do, introspection is something that intelligent beings can undertake. stop fucking consuming. it doesnâ€™t fill the holes. it just makes new ones that have to be filled later on.

how does friction work?

(diagrams: curves in speed over time)

what if you replace speed with inertia? does resistance to change diminish over time? or does it increase?

a deck of cards, chips -- randomness, agency. a betting game, a game of risk and chance and reward.

clouds scuttle overhead while we make and lose our fortunes. rattle and roll the bones. in our self importance we have no idea how tiny and fleeting we are. ghosts vying for a seat in heaven, jockeying for immortality.
