we didn’t call it loving. we called it something else. when we were in each other, i guess that’s what it was. something else. desperate fleeting acts of mortality, reaching for starstuff when our bodies were too small, too frail, our hearts too broken. call it many names, call it love, call it nothing. what is loving after all? where do our needs get us when all is said and done? here and now, enriching. no past, no future. just bodies bent and folded, hard and soft, poetry in motion, shuddering prose in stillness. where was loving, what would that be? loving came during, after, before. at all points but one. loving was waiting for food after. loving was the pressing need to be closer even when that could never be. loving was what we were.
