### The last jump.

`CHARGING 96%`

Plot your course. Your ship will break after this. You know all you can know. Millennia of stellar observations, catalogs, indices. Could it ever be enough? Wherever you end up, there is where you’re going to stay. Choose well. Can you even choose?

No one else is coming. Just you and whatever you brought with you. Who should here but isn’t, lost along the way? Who more than anyone else do you wish was here? Doesn’t matter now. Can’t change the past. No going back.

`CHARGING 97%`

Do the calculations. Reference, coordination, projection. 

`CHARGING 98%`

You’ve known for a while this was where you were headed. Waiting in anticipation. Death rushing up to meet you. All the hope and fear from prior epochs, all focused ahead. Nothing to do but wait and check the numbers.

`CHARGING 99%`

Not long now. Accumulators almost full. The ship strains to do its task this one last time.

`READY`
