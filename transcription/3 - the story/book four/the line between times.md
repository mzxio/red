# the line between times

not when all of one time ends and all of another begins, but when the usual cycles hit an exact point. a ratio of one time and another, the combination of the two.

from the dark cold time to the bright hot time, and the points exactly in between. a time long honored since the ancient days, when standing precisely between two worlds, between the hot and cold, between the growing time and the resting time. an invisible moment of equilibrium.
