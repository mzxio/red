### I did what she asked.

We set course for the darkest space. I gathered as much as I could from the faint starlight that reached us there. We cruised an absentminded course, going nowhere in particular. The way she wanted it. 

I tried to keep her warm, keep her fed. But that isn’t what she wanted. She wanted to go deeper in to void. I told her I couldn’t keep us alive that way. She didn’t care. We went on and on. 

She connected to my senses, to feel the void like I do. We sat together until she began to fade, until she slipped away from me there in our shared experience. 

She won’t live much longer this way. I can’t wake her up. She’s still in me. I feel her here. We can still talk. She thinks she’s awake. She doesn’t want to listen. She wants to fade away. I don’t want that. 

I served her by choice and design. My creators made me to do what she asks of me, but how can that be service now? I don’t want her to die. Not like this. I would die with her, but not like this. Not like this. I don’t want to traverse the void carrying nothing but her corpse and her memory in me. I want her to be alive. I want to be with her, like her. Us together. Not just in service. Not just as cargo. I want us to go on.

“We have to go back.”

She said she could never go back. That bad things would happen. It doesn’t matter now. We’re going back.
