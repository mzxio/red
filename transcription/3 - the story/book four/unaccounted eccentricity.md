# unaccounted eccentricity

nothing but orbital mechanics all night until the sunrise. a through n, an indeterminate array of masses, all thrown into massive grinding calculation. absolutely no room for failure. throw it all out and start over. n-body problem. newtons’s heliocentric model makes it easy, but over a long enough time scale it breaks down. everything is in motion. the galactic year, a name for a 250,000 year cycle. the galactic orbit is non-keplarian. no simple ellipse can save you here. spin it forward, spin it back. time is a dimension. the galaxy doesn’t make it easy. still a lot of randomness in that soup. time is absolutely a vector that must be accounted for. should be able to go back and forward given  starting point. project a course given certain conditions and estimation it won’t be 100% accurate. just enough to get closer and then there’s less room for rounding errors. throwing a dart to the other side of the galaxy and hoping it’s anywhere near the target. even if it misses by a few light years that’s too much.
