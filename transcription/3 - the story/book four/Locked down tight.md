# Locked down tight.

razor wire, guards everywhere. men with guns. lights, cameras, armored trucks. we were inside the perimeter. their front was secure but the back not so much the guys in the motor pool were all low security. we tried to spoof access to get into the main facility. i botched the process. they were pulling us aside. a technical glitch, they said. never seen anything like it. the door was open. i went into the bathrooms. we got up on the roof. so weird. meticulously clean, fresh paint, but no extra security. no cameras. the guys with guns and the barbed wire are still just there, but their attention is directed outward, not in. we find a sheltered spot on the roof where no one can see us. i go down into the garage. dark. a little security. i get what we came for. i tell my source from the motor pool to get out. he’s gone far enough. i get outside the fence, come back around the front. i’m supposed to be here, i have a meeting. but we’re blown. they try to trap us. we run. i have to hold my friend (up) as we go. he’s not used to this much. we get to the park, to the boulevard in the city. blown. botched. plan b time.
