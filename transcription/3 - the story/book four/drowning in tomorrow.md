# drowning in tomorrow.

walking dream cities. real, imagined, what’s the difference? it’s all the same city at different times, different places, different people. they make the city different but everywhere the city heart beats. just when there’s enough people all together somewhere, that heart beats. drowning in tomorrow. popping the blisters, draining their salty pouch burns from forgotten hot surfaces, or was it from too much walking? mile after mile in the city, year after year. all the faces run together. whoever it is, you’ll never see them again. except when you do. hours or days later, when you realize you walk the same road for a little while. commuters on the same train, on the same schedule, waiting by the tracks. waiting in line for coffee or breakfast. waiting in the elevator. waiting long enough to look at each other and remember. but the heart-beating city washes that away once you sink back into the flow of it. ebbing at night, flooding by day. dragged along like a passive being in the surf. the tide is coming in. tomorrow’s tide will be higher.
