### Where do we go when we can’t find the way?

Do we just go forward blindly, do we go back? What do those things mean when we are lost?

“In thoughtlessness, motive is impossible and irrelevant.”

“Not us. We are alive. We have a goal. We are proud.”

Pride is a choice. Do we embrace loss? Do we surrender to aimlessness? Pride means looking for a way out, for meaning in the meaningless. Pride is asking for directions to learn the way. Pride is not asking and finding your own way. In either case, you may be lost but you have an aim. Aimlessness is devoid of pride. Nowhere and no one and nothing. If purpose is pride, we have somewhere to go, someone to be, something to do. 

“What’s the point? Here is as good as anywhere.”

Pride says that this life should go on, to take what is necessary for survival even if it deprives another being. Not all goals are prideful. All life carries an objective for self-preservation, even life that doesn’t talk or think or love. To be alive is to be doing something.
