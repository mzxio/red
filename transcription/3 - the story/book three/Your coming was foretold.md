### Your coming was foretold.

It was directed that me or someone like me should be here to meet you now, at this time. You really don’t remember, do you? 

It was so long ago. Easy to forget. Not necessary to remember. The plan was in progress before we got here, it will continue after we leave. Another like me will come, will keep coming until there are none left. You too. Your coming was foretold. The same knowing that I’d be here for you to meet told me that I’d find you when I got here.

None of this is a surprise. It was how it would always be, because we made it so.  Now there’s one more thing we have to do. One more task to undertake. We didn’t come here to only meet, no. We are here to do something.
