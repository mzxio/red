### After the massacre the bodies don’t even look like people anymore.

Dark lumps in the snow, lying in brown stains. They don’t move. They don’t look like anything. Fallen trees. Trash. But something about them says different. A sense like something is concealed. Look closer until a familiar shape stands out and brings all the other shapes into focus.

A face. Hands. A foot.

You see how they’ve fallen, so twisted and not-natural. Frozen in the last second of the life they had. Smoke still rises from the burning flames of what they used to have, while they are left face up in the snow.

Dead. Slaughtered.

Some seem so peaceful. A quiet grace but for the holes in their bodies. Silent horror of understanding etched on their faces.

Executed, massacred. Dead. All dead.

Anyone who made it out alive is far away by now. The ones who did the killing are gone too. They left the fires and the bodies. Not trash, but trash to them. Too much trouble to be left alive, too much trouble to be given any respect in death.

We’ll lie in the snow and the ashes of our lives will settle on our frozen upturned faces and we’ll all be forgotten.
