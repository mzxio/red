### They killed us.

The guardians in the north, dead. In the east, dead. In the south, dead. In the west, dead... all dead. They came and wiped us out. None of them did anything to stop it.

Where the land was good, they wanted it for themselves. They rolled over us like floods, like fires, like earthquakes, like tornados. Everywhere we went, they came. Wherever we were, they killed us. They exterminated us, starting with the strong. 

Some stayed low, behind the protectors. Some survived. They moved us from where we were. They gave us a choice, trust them to rule or die. We didnâ€™t trust, but what other choice did we have? If we were to live at all it had to be under their laws, always changing. They always wanted more. When our bad land turned out to be full of riches, they took what was left and sent us away. 

Then came the day there was nowhere else for us to go.
