### War is an articulation of dominance.

The capacity to make someone do something they don’t want to do is often the capacity to do something worse. The loaded weapon carries this weight.

“Do this thing or I’ll do something worse.”

War goes farther. When the objective is total destruction, no choice is given. You fight and kill first or be killed yourself. Destruction or subjugation. 

Rarely is it so clear-cut. Two sides almost never have equal capacity. One has the weapon and one has none. The stakes aren’t always obvious, nor are the relative strengths of the actors.

One ancient empire who dominated for centuries was almost always outgunned in their early days. They won by refusing to surrender, by wearing down the fortitude of their opponents.

The same dynamics of power in struggle can scale from the smallest confrontation to total war. It is useful to ask why the confrontation occurred to begin with, but often by the time the answer is made clear it’s too late to change the course of events. 

“Make me.”
