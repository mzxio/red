### Roving tribes wandering the desert.

For generations, looking for a place that was promised. Worshipping a new god. Receiving commandments. Escaping old gods, battling the gods of the desert. 

A pantheon of gods with their own villages and cities, with their own rules. 

Finally arriving at the land that was promised, the place of the covenants, and it is not virgin territory. It belongs to another tribe, other gods. So the wanderers kill all those inside, casting down and burning all other gods except theirs.

So it is that the promised few came to godâ€™s chosen land. 

Again and again the story repeats. Old places with it big rulers, old gods, calcified hierarchies. New gods with promises and adoration, only given with the right sacrifices. Promising a new place, never really quiet new. Infidels who must die to satisfy a divine blessing. 

Sooner or later we all find ourselves there, fighting between peoples.
