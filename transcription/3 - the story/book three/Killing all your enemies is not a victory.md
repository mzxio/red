### Killing all your enemies is not a victory.

When there is no one left, there is no chance for anything else ever again. It is nothing but completion. An ending. Failure. 

Death in totality.

When you stand among the bones of your enemies, you are the enemy. Turn your weapons on yourself or go on forever seeing the dead around every corner. 

Youâ€™ll give yourself reasons keep going. If there are no enemies, that reason is gone.

Your enemies may be gone, but we will never be forgotten.
