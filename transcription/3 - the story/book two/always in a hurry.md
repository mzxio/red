# always in a hurry.

a hurry for something. get somewhere, get something. get it done, get it in, get on to the next thing. always rushing to finish. even procrastinators are hurrying in their aimlessness, hurrying to do anything else but whatever needs doing. do it all, do it not at all, but get going. the rushing days of increased productivity, the hasty nights on the come down. appointments and schedules and time slices all stacked. time wasted too. rush to get the tv on, to have a constant feed of information streamed into minds and ears and eyes. if it breaks, rush to get it fixed. make it somebody else’s problem, if you can’t rush make them rush for you. now now now. it was not always so, but that’s true for a lot of things. i can’t seem to rush, doing it fast isn’t in me when the sun creeps over the horizon and today is now.
