### The water goes on forever.

The ocean will swallow me up without a trace. Maybe somewhere it ends but if I don’t live to see it the ocean, my ocean, will be eternal.

The water and the waves washing over the wood.

Don’t fear bleeding into the water, nothing is biting here. Only the salt spray and the sun. Nothing to do but wait. Wait for the wood to fail, for the drinking water to run out, for the ocean to rise and cover me up one last time.

All that’s left is to be adrift, and wait. 

The sun is setting. It will get cold tonight but not cold enough. Here the water stays warm, on a current from who knows where, running to who knows where. It laps against the wood, pulling me along.

I breathe until I don’t. The current will do the rest.
