### We didn’t meet anyone on the road.

Leaving the cities, heading into the heart of desolation. We thought we’d see at least someone out there. Fleeing the cities, tracing a circuit between towns.

Past lonely overpasses, bridges over turns into whatever hidden settlements used to lurk behind the hills. Past rugged buildings hungry for war, long empty and silent. Past the old ports of entry from when there were still borders, when someone still cared enough to enforce them. Past the old fuel stations where they used to stop and rest and fill up with whatever they used to run on. 

Finally coming to the mountain pass. Blocked. No one will come up here to fix it. Have to take the long way round from now on.  The roads go back to trails, worn down by passage of the few like us.
