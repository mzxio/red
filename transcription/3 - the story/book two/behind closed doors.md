# behind closed doors.

 in the building with the empty lobby. only the directory and a security camera and a locked door. upstairs, out of sight, is where they do their work. by the palm trees and the cracked parking lot, waiting for a chance. people come in and out, taking their smoke break, suspiciously eyeing any passerby. this is their domain, no one else is invited in. they make their movies, the men with bad hair and the women in short shorts, and all the tired scruffy people behind the camera. the guy with the voiceover truck on wheels lurks in the parking lot at noon, when we all walk down to the sandwich shop or the coffee shop or the bakery. all the posh people drive their fancy cars down the boulevard, in the endless summer between the desert and the sea. what are they making in those darkened rooms upstairs? i think you know, even though the company listed on the board in the empty lobby sounds mundane and almost friendly. spare a thought for the ones who come in and out. i wonder if they really want to be there.
