### Sunrise in a place with no mornings.

Daylight in a place with no sun. Rock in a place with no ground. Compassion in a place with no love. Loss when thereâ€™s nothing left to lose. Only tomorrow can tell but tomorrow never comes. The day of the end of all things. 

They said it was so important. They said it was the only way. They said this is just how it is. They said it was unrealistic to hope for more. To pray for sun in the sunless sky, for earth on the unsteady ground.

Instead we came here.
