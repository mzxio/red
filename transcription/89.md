seeing things that were not there. ghosts of peripheral vision. by the time you turn your head they’re already gone. nothing left to see here. move along. checking in, recounting the state of things. the village both exists and does not exist. the valley goes on. we’ve heard of rains and floods and fire, seen some evidence that at least one fire did destroy the village utterly, at least once. (-the valley flooded and-) at least once the village (-at least-) was destroyed, at most it never (-was- existed). a lake instead. we’ve seen a shimmering timelapse through eras and variations. very little on the people who lived there. like the city, some variants. burning from bombs, from some great cataclysm. normal days showing mature settlement, before or after other disasters. the ruined city, either still aflame or s one time after. the resettlement, coming back and fighting for territory. very little on the people. nothing about how the city came to be. except maybe not. other visions of an ancient town, fortified. all we’ve seen there is the view from the fortifications as an army is camped outside. a siege. where is it, who is laying siege? for how long? some things about warfare have come out. maybe that’s related. some other more abstract visions too. maybe tomorrow we’ll learn more.
