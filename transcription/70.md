“who makes the grass green?” he asked.

walking through some old neighborhood, uninvited, careful to be unthreatening. got a pass from the tribes. don’t flaunt difference, not what you’re here for. just here to love, to see what you see, to be. “try to remember to forget” someone said. in the evening, in the twilight, with fragrant flowers and trees, sounds of birds and wind, maybe some music or laughter. could be any neighborhood anywhere. still rare, still precious. not like anywhere else. this repetition, around and around in circles, spheres, spirals, toroidal knots. all tangled up together. so who makes the grass green? who? is there even a who? if the tree falling in the forest makes a sound, does someone need to be there to hear it? does the bird make sounds only for other birds? do we? is the grass green if there’s only other grass? i make the grass green for me. the bird has to be there, i have to be there, the twilight has to be there. none of it is complete without all of us, the cosmic “I.”
