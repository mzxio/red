“nothing happened the way it was supposed to,” $￼ that’s what he said. and the snow came down, slow at first, thicker and heavier, then blowing whiteout. rushing in the lights at night like star trails. only one of us made it out alive. he was right, nothing went according to plan. all our ideas, fantasies, careful preparation, all wrong. all unprepared. reality has a coarse shape, not neat, not tidy, not to be tamed by some planning by mortal beings. it felt right when it all went wrong. like that’s what was coming the entire time. we all knew it, even though we claimed not to know the future. the future was always there. the shape of things to come is always written in the shapes of what is. not that it made it any easier when it all went wrong and we were careening off a cliff. all i could think in the moment before i died was, this isn’t the last time.
