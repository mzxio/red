the old stories, just repeating over and over.

it’s like we’re riding these cycles even against our will.

when was the first time one being decided to help another being for no more reason than because compassion compelled them? not some accidental act, but deliberately, without expectation or desire for reward? and not the kind of reward coming from righteousness either. when was the first self sacrifice for an other? that word -- other. so loaded. what are you? other (please explain). other-ness. us and them other is the great wide expanse beyond known, other is alien, foreign, unknown. but how unknown is any other being, really? does life ever have any unexpected motivations?
