why is a conviction either cultivated with dedication or handed down from on high? why is it that we made our gods into judges and avenging demigods whose dialect requires years of study? why did we pervert the laws of physics and nature with edicts over ourselves that have nothing to do with goodness or consistency? the dictates of society became so twisted that we’d go to war over enforcing them, or stand by and shrug those wars off when those doing battle didn’t share our fundamental tenets? in the old world they said we must drop bombs or have bombs dropped on us. the measure of power is a measure of our capacity to destroy. by putting a gun to someone’s head we can get them to do what we say, but that isn’t power, just domination. nothing can grow in such soil.
