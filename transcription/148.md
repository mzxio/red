 how much is left of you? where is the most of you? where, what timeline? what intersection is the one where i find you? this universe is too big to search everywhere. i don’t have very much time left. this timeline is collapsing, reforming itself. soon i won’t be able to go back to where we crossed paths. that meeting could peace to exist and i will be left with only memory and a vague sense pulling at me like a magnetic field. somewhere, that way. those are the units, the measurement. there’s no way to be sure. the people of this world, most of them missed the hour of their reckoning. they thought something else was happening. but we knew. we were right there, lingering by the river. that was when my world ended. when i left and went to another reality. when i traveled forward to escape the dissolution. now this world too. i had my reckoning and now they are having theirs. and i’m all out of fuel this is where i crashed. whatever happens now, i’m here too.
