### Birdsong.

As long as something remains, there are the birds. Why would they care about our blasted hell?

Still warm, still smoldering. All burned, all ruined. Soot and ash. Minerals. Components. Melted shapes once familiar. No codes, only noise and torment.

Blank vision. Until a curve comes into focus, there a familiar pattern emerges. Shock, horror. Recognition. Corpse, artifact. It looked like junk, like nothing. Blackened bones, charred and congealed. What should never be separated, scattered carelessly. 

The ones left, numbed. What was abhorrent becomes usual. Picking through the rubble, they find what remains. 

The birds still sing.
