### Birdsong.

Someone said that at the end of a slaughter all that’s left is blood and shit. Someone said all that’s left is the birds in the trees. As long as something remains, there are the birds. Why would they care about our blasted hell?

The wreckage is still warm, still smoldering. All burned, all ruined. Reduced to soot and ash. Minerals. Components. Melted shapes that were once familiar. Picking through. No coded impressions. All is noise and torment, blank vision.

Until a curve comes into focus, there a familiar pattern emerges.

Shock, horror. What was just rubble and ruin becomes familiar. A corpse, an artifact. It looked like junk, like nothing. In focus nothing becomes blackened bones, charred flesh congealed. All the components that should never be separated, scattered carelessly. 

The ones left living are shocked and then numbed. What was abhorrent becomes usual. Picking through the rubble, they find what’s left. 

The birds sing all the while.
