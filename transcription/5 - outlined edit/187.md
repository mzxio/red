### Too many to name. Too many forgotten, or best forgotten.

Once a sea. Dry now, dry before. It will be a sea again before long. Generations of us. Walk the plain while you can, worn down by floods and the grinding of the sea that was. 

Little cuts of young rivers running between the smooth ancient hills. All those countless ages of life above, dying and falling to the ground. Corpses collected, buried, compressed.

Now we till the ground, churn up their bodies. They break down even more. Almost unrecognizable now. Good ground for cultivation. Crops come in we take them to market. We eat the last thing that remembers those ancient creatures. Seeds grown from plants that dug deep and consumed the ancient bones. How many times will the cycle repeat?

We will go to join those old forgotten dead, and be born anew.
