### Procession through crowds.

“Bring out the applicants.”

The first, the first’s honored, the followers. A day for one, a day for many. They walk, they march. The crowds part and let them pass. They go through to the meeting place. Important ones are there already, waiting. Observe the rites. 

Stiff moves in heavy garb for ceremony. Honors bestowed. Far away bells and trumpets. Filling up the high place with cheers and applause, all the way up to the distant ceilings.

The highest of the low. Ace, first among equals. Second, dismissed from service.

A show of unity, synthesizing power with the old rituals. Shadows of ancient magic, reawakened by the collective delusion of the crowd. All reduced to a few words, a spectacle, a trinket.

When the crowds have ebbed and the bells no longer ring off the stones, all that remains are the applicants. When none can see, they go on their way.
