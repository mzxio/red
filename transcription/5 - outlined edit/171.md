### Precession through crowds.

Ceremony, bestowing honors. one, two. the applicants. the first, the firstâ€™s honored, all the followers. a day for one, a day of many. they walk, they march. the crowds part and let them pass. go through to the place with the important people waiting to talk, to confer their honor, to observe the old ceremony. stiff moves in heavy garb, far away trumpets. the space fills with cheers and applause, all the way up to the distant ceilings. first becomes ace, first among equals, the highest of the low. the second receives nothing, dismissed from service when the crowds have ebbed and the trumpets no longer ring off the stones. the important people have given their spectacle, put on their show of elevating the low to an exalted place. when none can see they go on their way unimpeded by worries. the spectacle was a show of unity, synthesized with the power of the old rituals, a shadow of ancient magic reawakened by the collective delusion of the crowds. all of it reduced to just a few words, an honor conferred. the spectacle lost, all that remains are the two.
