### Precession through crowds.

Honors bestowed in ceremony. Bring out the applicants. The first, the first’s honored, the followers. A day for one, a day of many. They walk, they march. The crowds part and let them pass. They go through to the meeting place. Important ones are there already, waiting to talk, to confer the honors, to observe the rites. 

Stiff moves in heavy garb rarely worn. Far away bells and trumpets. Filling up the high place with cheers and applause, all the way up to the distant ceilings.

The highest of the low. Ace, first among equals. Second, dismissed from service. The important ones have given their spectacle, put on their show of elevating a low one to exaltation. When none can see, they go on their way.

A show of unity, synthesizing power with the old rituals. Shadows of ancient magic, reawakened by the collective delusion of the crowd. All reduced to a few words, to a trinket.  When the crowds have ebbed and the bells no longer ring off the stones, all that remains are the two applicants.
