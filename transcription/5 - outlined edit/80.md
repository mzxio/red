### There will be loss.

It’s risky and dangerous. You never know what you’ll be able to take with you. Even if you take everything with you at the crossing, something will be lost. 

You may not even notice. Nothing may look or seem different, which in turn may lead you to believe that you were unsuccessful. Don’t be deceived. 

Much you’ll forget without ever realizing it. Where memory used to be remains, so you may perceive absence but fail at any attempt to retrieve whatever used to be there. This is a good sign that you have succeeded in traveling.

If you experienced a time when everything stopped making sense, when all that was familiar became foreign or frightening, when all of a sudden all the things that brought comfort instead brought confusion, then you have been traveling. You have likely traveled and not even known.
