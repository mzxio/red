### What’s left when all your friends are dead?

What’s left when there’s no fight left and no one to carry the day? Behind the wall under lock and key?

The demoralized army surrendered in shame, they said. Decimated and cut off, fleeing into the hills. Some took off their colors and sank into the peoples who overwhelmed them. Transform, assimilated and subsumed. Their ways washed away by the conquerer’s rampant need to be master over all. 

What if the one who was once an enemy is now living next door? If you knew you had such a neighbor, would you fight them again? Would you feel threatened? Would they be an affront to your domination?

“If you can’t see it or hear it, you won’t think it.”

You say your enemy came from far away. Savages, barbarians from another land. Never your kin. Would you even know the difference? Would you have won so utterly in your mind that your way was only ever the one real way?
