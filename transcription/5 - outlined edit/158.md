### What’s left when all your friends are dead?

What’s left when there’s no fight left and no one to carry the day? Behind the wall under lock and key?

The demoralized army surrendered in shame, some say. Decimated and cut off, fleeing into the hills. Some took off their colors and sank into the society that annihilated them. So defeated as to transform, assimilated and subsumed by your culture. Their ways washed away by your wild rampant need to be master over all you survey. 

What if the one who was once an enemy is now living next door? If you knew you had such a neighbor, would you fight them again? Would you feel threatened? Would they be an affront to your domination?

“If you can’t see it or hear it, you won’t think it.”

You say your enemy came from far away. Savages, barbarians from another land. Never your kin. Would you even know the difference?  Or would you have won so utterly that your way was only ever the one real way?
