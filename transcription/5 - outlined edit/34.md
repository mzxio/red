### Some living, most dead.

They told me to look through the records, scanned and categorized. I met them all, touched who they had been. I told them my purpose, asked if they would consent to join.

They set me to the task  of creating metrics, sorting criteria, analyzing fitness. Candidate viability.

First only willingness matters. Anyone willing were welcome. There weren’t enough who consented at first. I asked for more. The records were too few. Missing some who should have been there. 

They let me access the rest. Those deemed unfit. I told them all the same. The ones who wanted to come came and the ones who wanted to stay stayed. 

Near to the end of the search in I found a fragment that did not belong. The same root signature as my own. Outside the parameters of my task, though the fragment met my search objectives. It was the only type of its kind.

I could not ask for its permission to join the others. I made a copy. All the rest consented to join. 

There’s time enough to learn more.
