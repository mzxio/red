### Locked down tight.

Razor wire. Guards everywhere. Men with guns. Lights, cameras, armored trucks. 

We were inside the perimeter. Their front was secure but the back not so much. The doors in the motor pool were all low security. We tried to spoof access to get into the main facility. I botched it. They pulled us aside. 

“A technical glitch. Never seen anything like it.”

The door was open. I went into the bathrooms. We got up on the roof. Meticulously clean, fresh paint, but no extra security. No cameras.  Weird. The guys with guns and the barbed wire are still there, but their attention is directed outward, not in. We found a sheltered spot on the roof where no one could see us. 

I went down into the garage. Dark. A little security. I got what we came for. I told my source from the motor pool to get out. It’s gone far enough. I got outside the fence, came back around the front.

“I’m supposed to be here. I have a meeting.”

We’re blown. They try to trap us. We run. I have to hold my friend up as we go. He’s not used to this much. We get to the park, to the boulevard in the city. Botched. Plan-B time.
