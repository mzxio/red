### Isn’t there one among you?

Who holds the keys? Who is it? Who do you trust with the keys of your wretched kingdom? Who decides who goes and who stays? Who sleeps in the gatehouse? Who keeps the hordes at bay? A billion howling souls in bedlam and only one gate.

“One way in, one way out.”

When hell is full, where do you put the wailing masses? Do you leave them in the fields between worlds, between countries, in seething crawling infinite purgatory? Unwanted in life, unwanted in death, a product of meddlesome beings more powerful than they could ever be? Useless bugs given soul but no purpose, left in the garden to fend for themselves and kicked out of heaven for asking why?

What will you do, oh devil, what will you do with the children of industry?

What will you do with the millions of casualties? God left a long time ago, doesn’t want them now. You know that, devil, as no one else does. You were there, weren’t you, at God’s final judgement? What a lazy judgement it was. Creator tired of creation and went off to create another. You, devil, left to pick up the pieces, left to tend to God’s children. 

If only you cared more. If only God had not made you to be the judge of our souls. You don’t have a soul, devil, you are older than souls. Still you hold the keys to all our ascensions. Let us go. Open the gates and let us quit this wretched place.

Let us be free.
