### The last human.

When everyone else has moved on, died from their unnatural consequence and reborn elsewhere, one stays behind. Walking the empty sidewalks in the city. Looking over the finite ocean. She knows it ends somewhere just beyond the horizon.

“We don’t go there any more.”

She sits in empty restaurants, quiet shops. Processes suspended. The food in the market never goes stale. Eternally, meticulously, unnaturally clean. Dust stops in the air. Unreality takes its place. Pieces fall away. 

Cycles still run. Animus. She is not alone. Some other beings still dwell here. None like her. Wildlife, sun and moon and stars. Excuses. In the desolate city they always run into each other. The last passengers on a sinking ship, waiting for the last flood.

`Shutdown.`

 The end comes cold and quiet and sudden but she waits all the same.
