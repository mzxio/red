### The last human.

When everyone else has moved on, died from their unnatural consequences to be reborn elsewhere, one stays behind. Walking the empty sidewalks in the city. Looking over the finite ocean. It ends somewhere, over there just beyond the horizon.

“We don’t go there any more.”

She sits in empty restaurants, quiet shops. Processes suspended. The food in the market never goes stale. Eternally, meticulously, unnaturally clean. Dust stops in the air. Unreality takes its place. Little by little all the normal pieces fall away. 

Animus. The cycles still run. She is not alone. Some other beings still dwell here. None like her. Wildlife, sun and moon and stars. Convenient excuses. In the desolate city they somehow always run into each other. The last passengers on a sinking ship. Waiting for the last flood. Shutdown. The end.

 The end will come cold and quiet and sudden but she waits all the same.
