### Waiting before war.

You know what’s coming. You see it with eyes closed, with eyes open. Storm clouds gather. The birds and beasts have fled and it’s just us merry band of idiots versus them and whatever horrors they’ve invented just for us today. 

Weapons buzz in the air. Soon there will be a battle. Soon we’ll be able to make our point in a way they’ll hear, or fade away in the attempt. It either works or doesn’t. If we fail we may as well not be around to see it. They won’t give us another chance. We’ll throw everything else away and fight the fight that’s in front of us. 

None of that happens now though. Now is the waiting. Now we have to be alright with silence and tension.

“When will the first stroke fall? How long do we have to wait?”

“No one knows.”

“Could we wait them out? Could they just leave?”

“Doubt it.”

We’ll stare each other down a while longer. Watch them gather their strength, as we gather ours.

Not forever. 

Soon the wait will be over.
