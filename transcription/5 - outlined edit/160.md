### You don’t need a body.

It is possible to leave a body, go elsewhere, and then return. Some time will have elapsed for the body in your absence. However long you were gone is also the amount of time elapsed. It’s possible to miss much. Your body can carry on like you were never gone. 

“And another thing...”

You may find the meaning of words has changed. Best not to make assumptions about where you are. The universe is constantly in motion. We generate entropy moving through it. Don’t trust any landmarks. Mountains and valleys can be relied upon for a while, but even they are not fixed.
