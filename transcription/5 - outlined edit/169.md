### Trying to forget, even when there is no forgetting. $

The long walk back.

Beyond the village in its valley, to the water.

Across the water, slow timelessness, to another valley. 

Mountains, rivers, fields. Birds flutter and sing.

The long dry road to the mesa, lonely and forgotten.

The infinite desolation, nothing but dust and scrub and burning sun.

Higher and higher. Rolling hills. Scrub turns to grass and trees.

The clouds come. Rain at last.

Looking back and seeing the road stretching beyond sight.

Rocks and grass and then another valley.

Bright and living, steaming in the late day sun. The river, the village.

Almost as if I never left.

No, a different place with different stories. 

A long way from here to there.
