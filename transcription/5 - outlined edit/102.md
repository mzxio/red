### In ones and twos they came.

Eighty-six minutes past the hour of destruction. They began arriving. The unattached, the desperate, the lonesome. Singles, couples, threes and fours and more. They assembled groups, families, tribes, clans. 

Not even two hours after the old world ended they began building the new world. Making what they would call theirs. Laying down marks, scratching at wood and stone. Building pieces, networks, caravans, trades. Habits, rituals, languages. Yours and mine held apart, together, the same.

Go in any direction or dimension. Look for universal shapes. Symbols of life’s perpetuation. As we begin so do we continue. A seed, a spore, a sperm, a shard. Essential parts of more complex geometry. Meshes, fabrics, lattices. So it went that the new world resembled the old one. 

“One becomes many, many become one.”
