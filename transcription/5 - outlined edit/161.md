### For millennia.

She walked between the stars. Never stopping, never resting.

She walked longer than the empire that created her. Longer than all the children of her cousins ever breathed. 

Still she walked.

Always forward, never back. Never to anywhere but her final destination. No one but her decided where we should go. Only she ever knew where. 

Our mother. For us she is our only god.
