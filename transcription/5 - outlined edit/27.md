### It isn’t where we are, it’s where we aren’t.

What is something? Maybe it’s anything, or everything. Do you know? Can you? Start with process, with action. Start with what it isn’t, or with the infinite. 

Infinity is the infinity of nothing. Dream of infinite something, of infinite is. In the infinite, everything is. No isn’t. Isn’t cuts away at infinity and leaves nothing but the smallest piece, the part we get to hold.

Just on the other side of infinite nothing is infinite something. You are the all-being, here and now. Everything else, everything extraneous, isn’t. You can have infinite is in infinitesimal isn’t. 

We are children of isn’t. We don’t know our boundaries but we are still bounded. Isn’t knows love and loss, knows here and now. In isn’t we find ourselves, our identities, our egos, our places. 

“When there is nothing left, we become forever.”
