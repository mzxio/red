### What answer is anyone supposed to have?

The ones who want something, can you give them what they want? The ones who don’t ask, how do you know? Do you know what they really believe?

If they’re peddling answers, they want you to believe as they claim to believe. Two versions of belief at least. Outside and inside. An unspoken answer and the answer that was given. Sometimes the same, or mostly not. Everything is true. Nothing is true. Hard to tell the difference.

Later when you know the answer it’s too late to make a change. You carry it with you over the threshold. Some answers you can change. You have to wait until you come back around again for another shot. 

Most of us, we’re stuck here. Living by our wits alone.
