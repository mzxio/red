### Wandering the desert.

For generations, looking for a place that was promised. Roving tribes worshipping a new god. Receiving commandments. Escaping old gods, battling the gods of the desert. 

A pantheon of gods with their own villages and cities, with their own rules. 

Finally arriving at the land that was promised, the place of the covenants, and it is not virgin territory. It belongs to another tribe, other gods. So the wanderers kill all those inside, casting down and burning all other gods except theirs.

So it is that the promised few came to godâ€™s chosen land. 

Again and again they fall. Weak rulers, tired gods kneel before new gods with promises and adoration, but only with the right sacrifices. Promising a new place that is never really new. First the infidels must die to satisfy a divine agreement.

Sooner or later we all come between peoples and their gods.
