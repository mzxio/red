### Too many voices, too many sounds.

Why won’t it ever stop? Scattered debris and dust and ashes. What is real? None of what was left remains. All previous agreements nullified, superseded. 

“No one can ever find the body. Only if you go looking in the past.”

“There is no retrieval, only observation.”

Complete and absolute despair. Look but never touch. The past is gone, the future is gone. The time traveler knows the exquisite interconnectedness of it all.

Now is just a small move, a single stone on the board. Together all the stones tell a story, but only in their arrangement and order, in the decisions of the players.

Pieces themselves are irrelevant, replaceable. So it is with all of us. Trade one for another, would you notice? Today a person in a suit sits across from you. Tomorrow, a different person, different suit, but still a person in a suit on a train. Would you care?
