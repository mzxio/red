### Like the tide coming in.

Long nights up until late. Looking for something. I was looking for understanding. I understood so little. Every day that’s true. Searching was my priority. You had other priorities. Everyone did. Everyone I met in those days, touched, talked to. Transparency of self, opacity of other. Fog of war.

_We see what we see. I wonder what you saw in me._

“We all have our motives.”
