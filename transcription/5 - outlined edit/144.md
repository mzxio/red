### At a council of war, remember why everyone is there. $

“If you don’t know, ask. When you ask, don’t expect a straight answer.”

“There is only ever one reason for war: control. There are many roads that lead to this one destination.”

War is a means to an end. Wars undertaken frivolously, or wars without bloodshed, these are still expressions of dominance and control. Take more than is taken, give more than is given. Show that you can destroy more than your enemy wishes to lose. Any war, any weapon, these are its messages. Its powers.

A war goes until someone has had enough. Who knows how long that will take? Winning is different in every case. When the sides are too evenly matched, neither attains dominance. They wait each other out, wait for the first to starve.

Sometimes winning is just about saying you won and not being questioned. Sometimes the winner is the one who loses less. No one wins. Some wars go on so long the combatants don’t know they’re fighting any more. Some weapons make people into fools. Some histories are written before a victor is known.

Whoever survives goes on to tell the stories.

At its heart, war is a test: who can destroy the most, and who will benefit?

“Here we are all warriors.”
