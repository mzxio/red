### They measured us by money.

Lifetime value, our worth to them. Our usefulness, their savvy. Anything to increase their earnings. Products and services, capture and retention. 

If we were high enough in value we were worth their time. If we were low value we were irrelevant, disposable. If we approached our estimated limit we could be discarded. They always made their money, so they said our patronage was never necessary. We were not necessary.

Once we were no longer earning for them, unless there was a chance we might earn again, our value dropped to zero. That’s how they saw the world. How they saw us. Maybe some of them thought it was a problem, but mostly they wanted to do it bigger. 

When it all went wrong they wished they’d taken more.
