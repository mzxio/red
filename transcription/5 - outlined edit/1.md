### Before the beginning there was no thing. Yet even then the story was told.

The story was told before the beginning. It will be told after the end.

We are all in the story. Our stories are the stories of the universe.

We can never be erased from time, but our stories are forgotten when there is no one left to tell them. 

Tell old stories. Make new stories. Cast your stories into the void. 

The universe begins.
