### The first age.

No final candidates yet. The process has begun.

One way forward, with the promise of many possible destinations. It will take some time to reach them, to make a closer examination. We’ll travel and run tests.

With no exact parameters to evaluate fitness or adaptability there can be no final candidates yet. No small domain, no added stimuli, no additional beings, no single process is enough. 

Within the aberration one stays locked, the other dreams. I have watched the dreams. Sometimes a fire in dark places, besieged by nightmare creatures. All darkened, all pursued. Labyrinthine walls seem to make them most at ease.

Perhaps it’s time to take them out of isolated domains and give them over to their own desires. A big and wild place, bustling, populous.

Perhaps they will awaken in the city.
