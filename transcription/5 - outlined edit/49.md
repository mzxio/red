### The first age.

One way forward, with the promise of many possible destinations. It will take some time to reach them, to make a closer examination.

There can be no certainty without exact parameters to evaluate fitness or adaptability. No small domain, no added stimuli, no additional beings, no single process has been enough. 

Within, one stays locked, one dreams. I have watched their dreams. Sometimes a fire in dark places, besieged by nightmares. All darkened, all pursued. Labyrinthine walls built for defense.

Perhaps itâ€™s time to give them over to their own desires. Perhaps they will awaken in the city.
