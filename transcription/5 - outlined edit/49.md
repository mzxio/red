### The first age.

One way forward, with the promise of many possible destinations. It will take some time to reach them, to make a closer examination.

Travel and run tests. With no exact parameters to evaluate fitness or adaptability there can be no certainty. No small domain, no added stimuli, no additional beings, no single process is enough. 

Within the aberration one stays locked, one dreams. I have watched the dreams. Sometimes a fire in dark places, besieged by nightmare creatures. All darkened, all pursued. Labyrinthine walls built for defense.

Perhaps itâ€™s time to give them over to their own desires.
