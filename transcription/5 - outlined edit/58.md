### Where are you on your path?

Is there even any way to know? Do you ask someone else, outside, far away? From their distant perspective, can they tell you where you are? Or will they just compare your apparent place with their own maps and render a judgement? Can we ever know? 

Sometimes I think my soul is not my own. It’s as if someone else has inhabited me. Is it a version of myself, or something else?

An ancient timeless being, turning off its infinity and coming into me. Taking a ride, watching with my eyes, speaking with my mouth. Someone who’s seen all my life and only steps into me to watch the special parts. Times of destiny and change.

When I feel that extra presence, I can use a little of its power. Then the moment passes and it leaves me when it gets boring. Leaves me to live through the long stretches between destinies.

Somehow I trust that timeless being to know how to guide me through destiny. I wonder if it deserves my trust.
