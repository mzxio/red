### How much wreckage is left out there?

Spacefaring tribes, running from world to world between stars. Rock to cloud to sun. 

Wars fought. Old junk left by long-dead civilizations who walked themselves into oblivion. Bodies left along the way, twisted and broken and forgotten on some airless sphere.

“What were they fighting for, and who were they fighting?”

Nomad-kin finding bones of ancestors. If we ever found some scrap, would we recognize it? Would it be a remnant of ourselves? Would we even want to know?
