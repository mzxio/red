### No one who’s still here remembers.

“When were the wheels of the machine were set in motion?”

“Centuries ago now, maybe more.”

Decisions made by people who have been dust longer than they were alive. Someone said that the dead have no rights over the earth, that only the interests of the living need be considered. Still the dead continue to work on us from beyond the grave. 

Their ghosts move in us, in institutions and the frameworks we use to understand our world. We take counsel from corpses. The dead are never really dead until we forget their names. Even then they may have set something in motion that we are powerless to stop, if we see it at all. 

Any revolutionary act is an act of future ghosthood. To bind ourselves to the same fate as the ancients, to have continuing influence over the living even when we can no longer live.
