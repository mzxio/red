### Behind closed doors.

In the building with the empty lobby, only the directory and a camera and a locked door. Upstairs, out of sight, they do their work. 

Past the trees and the cracked pavement, theyâ€™re waiting for a chance. Coming in and out. Smoke breaks suspiciously eyeing any passerby. This is their domain, no one else is invited in.

They make their designs, the ones with bad hair and the others with bare shoulders, and all the tired people behind. They lurk at noon, when we walk down to get a sandwiches and coffees. All the posh people drive their fancy toys down the boulevard, between the desert and the sea.

What do they make in those darkened rooms upstairs? I think you know, even though the company listed on the board in the empty lobby makes it sound like something else.

Spare a thought for the ones who come in and out. I wonder if they ever really wanted to be there.
