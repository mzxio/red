### The screwup.

The drunk in the gutter. That’s me. When they found me they thought I was so clever, so insightful. They liked what I had to say.

They didn’t know the screwup will always find a way to fail. Keep your expectations low when the screwup comes to town. No big ideas, big promises, big words. These are all easy. Take it from me, it’s not gonna work.

Whatever the promise, whatever the idea, there’ll be a reason. Even a good one. It’ll all fall apart. Maybe the screwup will run away, or maybe you will. Maybe there’ll be some piece left over, some ruins of a half-built dream. Burn them down if you want, or leave them where they are. They were never going to amount to anything anyway.

The screwup is a confidence trickster. Listening, watching, waiting for a tell. It’s like they can read your mind, scratch your innermost thoughts and desires. The most dangerous one is the gentle one, the one you’d never suspect. Even acting shady, they’ll give you reasons to believe.

It’s not just you. They make themselves believe, so they can make you believe too. The screwup fails because they con themselves.
