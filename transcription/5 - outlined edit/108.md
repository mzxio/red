# 108

### We didn’t meet anyone on the road.

Leaving the cities, heading into the heart of desolation. We thought we’d see at least someone out there. Fleeing, tracing a circuit between towns.

Past lonely overpasses, bridges over turns into whatever hidden settlements used to lurk behind the hills. Past rugged buildings hungry for war, long empty and silent. Past the old ports of entry from when there were still borders, when someone still cared enough to enforce them. Past the old stations where they used to stop and rest and drink their fill. 

Finally coming to a mountain pass. Blocked. No one will come up here to fix it. Have to take the long way from now on.  The roads go back to trails, worn down by passage of the few like us.
