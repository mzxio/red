### Ways to build the fire.

Harmony between air and fuel, combustion. The best fire, the most heat, the fastest cooking. Ancient ideas, whatever technology. An oven built with sand and water, mud and clay. Bricks salvaged from old buildings. Stones mortared carefully. The old log.

Draw in the air, the fire pulls it through even the smallest spaces. Control the flow, control the burn. Some small sticks, old growth, piles from the forest floor. The wind will do its job. 

The shelter, the enclosure. Make it to fit your needs. The woman in the woods said it’s what she uses to make her dinner.

“Build one of these and you’ll never go cold.”
