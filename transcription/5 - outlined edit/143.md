### At a council of war.

Remember why everyone is there? If you don’t know, ask. Don’t expect a straight answer.

There is only ever one reason for war: control.

There are many roads that lead to this one destination. War is a means to an end. Wars undertaken frivolously, or wars without bloodshed, these are still expressions of dominance and control. 

“Take more than is taken, give more than is given. Show that you can destroy more than your enemy wishes to lose.”

Any war, any weapon, this is its message. Its power.

A war goes until someone has had enough. Who knows how long that will take. Some weapons make people foolish. Sometimes when the sides are too evenly matched, they can’t express dominance so they wait each other out. Wars of attrition are the worst wars ever waged. 

Winning is different in every case. Sometimes winning is just about saying you won and not being challenged. Sometimes it’s who loses less. No one wins. In whatever case, the winner is usually whoever gets to tell the stories. Some wars go on so long the combatants don’t know they’re fighting any more. Some histories are written before a victor is known.

At its heart, war is just a test: who can destroy the most, and how much will that destruction cost? 

Here we are all warriors.
