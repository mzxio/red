### Never thought it would go like this.

Wrecked, forgotten, cold, hurt. No escape. Marooned. Small and cold and alone. Impossible forces of nature. Only by changing the planets and the stars would it be any other way. 

_Maybe rest here._

So many hours, minutes, seconds since the crash. What do those units count now? Days and nights are new here. Watch the motion of the spheres. 

Always over the next ridge. Never seems to come any closer. Maybe after walking a hundred years thereâ€™s something else. Keep walking all the way into another age. 

What will I find if I get there? Will there be anything? May yet live to see all these things and more. 

`You have arrived.`

_Where?_
