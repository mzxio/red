### The longest day.

Before anyone else knew, we knew. We knew all of this world was crumbling, washing out to sea. We drove like driving was all there’s ever been. We drove like our lives depended on it. We drove farther than we’d ever driven before.

Fingers entwined, hand in hand, we raced into the new world, grabbing at anything we found along the way. Everything will burn and all that made it good will shrink and wither and die. Created and destroyed. Like all worlds, eventually. What came after, rushing in to fill the empty space?

Our world was not to be, not for long. A nearly impossible divide. Paper over unchecked depths. Inside we had just enough to start again, to make another world. Instead we spent our last moments on the run. We were lost.
