### What is this place?

Elevator down. No symbols on the controls, only colors. A long ride deep into the ground. Deep enough to disappear from above. 

Levels of storage. On and on. All different sizes containers. Only symbols meant for scanners, nothing I can read. Supplies. Equipment. 

Whoever came here, they came correct. They built this place to last. Thought they were going to stay. They left everything. Enough for many, enough for one. Enough for a clan. 

How long have I been down here? Long enough. The air is fresh. Thereâ€™s food I can eat, and water. I could stay here for a while.
