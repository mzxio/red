### You said you used to live there.

You said to look for a place across the river, on the far side of the bay. You said no one was lining up  to live there, in an old rundown part of town.

We walked around, we talked. You took me to where they make the food like where you come from. We walked along the water where the boats came in. We held hands and you told me so sweetly about whatever. I forget now. I remember you hand and the boats and the light of the city on the water. Winding backroads dug into the hills.

Beginning, also the middle, also the end. Maybe none of it is true. No you, no city. The river winds through the hills instead, on the way to a misbegotten sea. An illusion built upon stones left by the last traveler.
