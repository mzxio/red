### Nobody noticed when the world ended.

They laughed and drank and sang. They chatted and smiled. They bought books and clothes and jewelry, glossy machines, food and shoes. They walked with bags held close. Lunch, dinner, takeout. Table for four or six or eight.

Two by two they came, but not us. We were one less one. A nothing, a fragment. In-continuous. A shattered line. The world ended and the world kept going. No one else saw it.

At the terminus, yesterday becomes a different yesterday. Tomorrow is the same as it was ever yet to be. Collapse. Crossing into the other domain. Folding other universes into one.

“Sometimes I can’t see it. Other times I can’t forget.”
