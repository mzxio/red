### A hundred ways to go wrong.


“Only one way for this to go right.”

leaders asking their people to do something they would never do themselves. yet if challenged, it is they who are the strong ones and we who are the weakly cowards for failing to answer their call. for king and country and honor and freedom and equality or whatever’s on tap for this generation, whatever words stir the heart and twist the mind. who doesn’t want honor? only the dishonorable. right? only the guilty run from the challenge of justice and righteousness. only the sinner would hide from the eyes of god. but these are not gods or even god-kings. our leaders are as human as everybody else. as lizard, as bear, as pig. any beast of the earth, all with access to the divine but none have sovereignty over other beings. to not answer the call is to not be deceived. who benefits? if many or all benefit, then yes, only the selfish coward does not answer. but how often do we we make such an impact? how often does a single soldier turn the tide of war? there are many ways to go wrong, only one way to go right.
