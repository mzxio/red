### A hundred ways to go wrong. 

Leaders demanding their people do what they would never do themselves. Yet they say they are the strong and we are the weak, cowards for failing to answer when they call. 

For king and country and honor and freedom and equality!

This generation, what words stir the hearts and twist their minds? Who doesn’t want honor? Only the dishonorable. Only the guilty run from the challenge of justice, the innocent fears no righteousness. Only a sinner would hide from the eyes of god. 

These are no gods or even god-kings. Our leaders are as any beast of the earth. None have sovereignty over other beings. Do not be deceived. Who benefits when a single soldier turns the tide of war? 

“Only one way for this to go right.”
