### Your coming was foretold.

It was directed that me or someone like me should be here to meet you now, at this time. You really don’t remember, do you? It was so long ago. Easy to forget.

The plan was in progress before we got here. Another like me came, kept coming until none were left. You too. The same knowing that I’d be here for you to meet told me that I’d find you when I got here.

None of this comes as a surprise. It was how it would always be, because we made it so.  Now there’s one more thing we have to do. 

One more task to undertake. We didn’t come here to only meet, no. We are here to do something. We must prepare.
