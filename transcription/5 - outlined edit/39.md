### At the meeting of three rivers.

Creaking wooden boat. Coming into harbor. Smoke and tar and salt, spices carried on the wind. Rowdy sailors down by the water.

Stepping off to stone, sturdy land. Walking terraced steps. Eating some kind of warm sweet food I’ve never had, sold by a girl from somewhere I’ve never seen. A thousand voices speaking a hundred tongues, arguing and laughing and dealing, bustling in the marketplace. 

“Why did you come here?”

All strangers, coming together here to meet the other strangers. For the waters of the rivers, for the trade, for the food, for absolution. Dragged onward by a desire for something forever out of reach.

Climbing the long stairs all the way from the docks to the top of the holy hill. The temple of the three mothers, the patrons saints of the city. There I met a priest of the oldest order. He told me where I might go.

“You’ll know when you see it.”
