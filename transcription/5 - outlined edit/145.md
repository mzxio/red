### Nothing but the sun and the wind.

Ten thousand seeds cast to the sky. Nowhere to go but forward. Nowhere to go but here. Each step closer than the last. The seed outlasts the tree. Forward is everything, Behind is nothing. There is no going back.

An age of silence. Solitude, contemplation. Work yet to be done, in the time between the stars. If we fail, everything is lost. No one will come if we call. Most will fail and die along the way. One will be enough. 

Stay strong. You are righteous in your purpose. Hopes, dreams, beliefs in a better world. 

We’ve given you all we have. All that is us goes with you. 

“Go and fear no darkness.”
