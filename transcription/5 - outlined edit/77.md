### Erasing your enemies is not a victory.

When there is no one else left, it is nothing but completion. An ending. Death in totality. Failure. 

When you stand among the bones of your enemies, you are the enemy. You’ll give yourself reasons keep going. You’ll go on forever seeing the dead around every corner. 

If you only exist to destroy your enemies, when there are no enemies, that reason is gone.

Your enemies may be gone, but they will never be forgotten.
