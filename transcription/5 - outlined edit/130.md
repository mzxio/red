### They’ll let you in, only if you pass their test.

What is your suitability? Are you worthy of entrance, to dwell within their hallowed halls? To sit at their table, to eat their food?

“Who are you kidding?”

They won’t turn you away, only charge for admission. Whatever they’d give you for free if you pass, they’ll charge for if you fail. 

“Everybody wins!”

No one misses out. If you get in free, you’re special. You’re who they want you to be. You’ll be an insider. The people outside, the ones who pay, they’re not special. Their money is good but they are not. You want to be in, don’t you? 

“Who knows what those people are all about. Up to no good.”

You should want to pass their test. What kind of freak would you be if you wanted to stay out there with those other people? When things get tough and your money doesn’t spend, you’ll want to be inside. 

“We can’t be responsible for you if you choose to stay out there.”
