### Keep to the road.

Do not stray too far from the fine line. The road offers little safety but the surrounding lands can be cruel and untamed. So it goes. Keep the sides at the side. Walk straight where you can. Follow the lines of the earth when there is no road. The way is not always obvious. 

There are places you should walk and places you should avoid. Places that do not belong to us but are the domain of beings older and longer living than ourselves. The elders of the hills and trees. If you havenâ€™t yet glimpsed its secrets, do not linger in the house of gods too long.

Their road is not yours. Their path will lead you astray.
