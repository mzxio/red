### Far from anywhere.

Canyon lands. Deep scars on the ground, worn away by ages. Years beyond count.

They say once every year a bird flies down and sharpens its beak upon a stone. In a thousand visits you wouldn’t know it had been there. The birds have been visiting longer than counting. 

Water runs its way here and there and carries the sand along with it. Wind follows the water, blowing away anything left dislodged or unstable. The bird, the water, the wind. They all made this place. From here it goes on forever, but it doesn’t go on forever.

The long desert, flat and undisturbed. Quiet and wanting, waiting. The mesas with their hidden secrets and forgotten history. The mountains tall and cold even now in these warm seasons. The grasslands, with their infinite skies. The canyons seem boundless but they are bound by all of these. 

Go in any direction. Choose wisely or don’t, either way you will arrive at a new place. Walk along the canyon rim or turn around and go back.  This place will be waiting all the same. Waiting for the bird, waiting for the rain. Maybe you should wait too.
