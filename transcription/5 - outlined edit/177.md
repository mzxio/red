### Drowning in tomorrow.

Real, imagined, what’s the difference? Any city is any city at different times, different places, different people. They change the outside but inside the same city heart beats.

When there’s enough people all together somewhere, the city heart beats. Drowning in mile after mile, year after year. Faces run together. Whoever it is, you’ll never see them again. Except when you do. Waiting on the same train by the same tracks. Waiting in line. Long enough to look at each other and remember. 

The heart-beating city washes memory away once you sink back into its flow. Ebbing at night, flooding by day. Dragged along passively in the surf. The tide is coming in now. Tomorrow’s tide will be higher.
