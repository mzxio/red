### Desert. Void.

Infinite desolation. Choices made this land. Nothingness and potential, there, just out of reach. Beyond the horizon. Hidden life revealed. Waiting at the shore.

“Don't know where, don't know when.”

Flames reflected in our eyes dull the light of distant stars. We take up the fire for ourselves. We observe the cycles, honor the ancient ceremonies, sing in the old ways. Laughter rings at the end of sorrow.

Sun traverses sky, horizon to horizon, day upon day. We rise up and fall again. Years pass in shuddering seasons. Wind and water etch their marks upon the face of the earth. We carry the fire.

"Upon entering such a universe, there is no way to return.”
