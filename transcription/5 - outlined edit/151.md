### They built the first village down by the river.

Mountains looked down at them from all sides. The river wound lazily through the valley, its ancient motions written in smooth land. Rich for cultivation.

It was good land for many centuries before it turned again.

Years of peace. Births and deaths, festivals of planting and harvest. Some disagreements that turned bloody. In good days the village rang with the sound of work, at night, after the singing died down, the village slumbered like a well-fed child. Their leaders made great proclamations that went unfinished, their elders made decrees that frustrated the young. 

“They lived as so many have lived.” 

“A simple life?”

Now the village is gone, the valley is dust, the people forgotten. Some ancient walls still stand, marking where some important buildings stood. Storehouses. The market. A potter. A meeting place. Outlines of stone.

Ash, soot, a blackening of the bones. Did the village burn? Accidents, attacks? 

Some of the villagers, left in a place of corpses left in respectful poses. Surrounded by gifts and mementos, little carvings and bottles and jewelry, ornamental dishes, cups, clothing. Not many here. Not enough to know much of anything about them. 

So long gone now. To have lived for centuries, to be dead for longer now. 

Even in dust, the valley remembers the village and holds it close.
