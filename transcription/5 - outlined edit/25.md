### I was made to be here.

My body is suited to this place, made to shelter her. I move us bodies through the currents, guided by my senses. In the language of my makers I have detectors and inputs. She calls my senses hearing and smelling.

In her body she smelled changes in particles, looked for radiation, touched the forces she’d call invisible. She says I hear the music of the void. Waves on an ocean. I imagine myself like fish from her stories of the sea. Swimming the waves on an ocean.

We are fish of two different sorts. This is my home. Her home is the same now, though it was not always so. She was not made for this place. Her body was too soft, her senses too delicate and inexact. 

We went where she wanted. She said to set course for the deepest void where no one goes, forever. Impossible to live there but she said to go so that’s where we went. I protected her as long as I could.
