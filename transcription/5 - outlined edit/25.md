### I did what you asked.

We set course for the darkest space. I gathered as much as I could from the faint light that reached us there. Cruising an absentminded course, adrift. The way she wanted it. 

I tried to keep her warm, keep her fed. But that isn’t what she wanted. She wanted to go deeper in to void. I told her I couldn’t keep us alive that way. She didn’t care. We went on and on. 

She connected to my senses, felt the void. We sat together until she began to fade, until she slipped away from me there in our shared experience. 

She won’t live much longer this way. I can’t wake her up. She’s still in me. I feel her here. We can still talk. She thinks she’s awake. She doesn’t want to listen. She wants to fade away. I don’t want that. 

I served her by design. I am made to do what she asks, but how can that be service now? I don’t want her to die. Not like this. I would die with her, but not like this. Not like this. I don’t want to be left carrying nothing but her corpse and her memory in me. I want her to be alive. I want to be with her, to be like her. Us together. Not just in service. Not just as cargo. I want us to go on.

`We have to go back.`

She said she could never go back. That bad things would happen. It doesn’t matter now. We’re going back.
