### Unaccounted eccentricity.

An array of masses, all thrown into massive grinding calculations. Absolutely no room for failure. Start over. Problems. Over enough time it all breaks down. Years, cycles, unforeseeable deviations. 

Spin it forward, spin it back. Time is a dimension. Galaxies don’t make it easy. A lot of unknowable in that luminous soup, beyond the dust. 

Go back and forward again given a new starting point. Project a course given certain conditions. Estimations won’t be completely accurate. Like throwing a dart to the other side of the galaxy and hoping for a hit. Any miss is too much.
