### Mesa country.

Why did they come so far, far from the sea, far from the fertile lands? What were they escaping? 

Some say these lands weren’t always so desolate. Great rivers flowed. Fields blossomed all year long. The first ones weren’t running from anything, but following the rivers to where they could live forever. 

They say things changed. The rivers changed course. Then there were no more rivers. No more fields. Everything and everyone died in famine and dust. Anyone left now descended from the ones who survived. 

They say there’s still one river, one valley, one village untouched. Somewhere beyond the still plains and the desolate mesas, somewhere in all of that, someone is alive. Ancient, forgotten. 

Wherever they are, they have answers.
