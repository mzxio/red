> “If I had to say that this book is **about** any one thing, it is about keeping on keeping on. An unflinching travelogue on the beauty and brutality of existence. A paean to the life that grows through the cracks in the pavement. And hella poetic and playing on so many heart strings at the same time.”
-S.I.
