### War is an articulation of dominance.

The capacity to make someone do something they don’t want to do is the capacity to do something worse. When the objective is total destruction, no choice is given. Fight and kill first or be killed yourself. Destruction or subjugation.

“Do what I say or you’ll be sorry.”

“Make me.”

Rarely do two sides have equal capacity. Mostly one has the weapon and one has none. The stakes aren’t always obvious, nor are the relative strengths of the actors. Some simply refuse to surrender, and win by wearing down the fortitude of their opponents.

It is useful to ask why any confrontation occurred to begin with, but by the time the answer is made clear it’s too late to change the course of events.
