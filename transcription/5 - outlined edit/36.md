### How can they decide?

How can they know what to risk if they don’t know the stakes? 

“You must participate in your own salvation.” 

Sacrifice is meaningless without an idea of why that sacrifice is being made, without a greater purpose. Sacrifice for self only benefits self, and not forever. Sacrifice for other, for a cause, can go on to mean something forever. For as long as that cause lives, for as long as anyone remembers. If the wager and reward is life itself, it doesn’t matter if anyone remembers. As long as there is life, that sacrifice will count for something.

True willing wholehearted sacrifice comes from knowing how much there is to lose, how much could be gained. Embrace the actuality of your situation and speak it clear to anyone who listens. 

When the stakes are high and time is running out, some will answer the call. They will come to bridge the precipice.
