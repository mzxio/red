### Ownership, control. 

Ways to apply violence against anyone who does what you don’t want. Ownership within a state is an affidavit that the state’s capacity to harm will be available if some qualification is met. Own property and the state’s weapons are available if someone uses your property without permission.

The state’s guns don’t support you or the land, they support the state’s mandate to hurt anyone who does what the state doesn’t like. They write complex laws describing what force is to be used and when, and what behavior triggers its invocation. Laws carried on from before the state.

“Touch my stuff and I’ll kill you.”

Writings in stone, carried on from stories told. Religions and heroes of a place. Here we adhere to these certain beliefs. These laws, these dictates define the scope of force and violence to use against any law breaker.

Violence has always been the law here, as long as anyone remembers. We hold on to this system because it binds us. It assures us that others we meet will adhere to the same beliefs, the same use of violence.
