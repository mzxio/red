### The commission.

Nights home late. Street lights leaking between the blinds. Neighbors all inside. Late paperwork and drinks and uneasy sleep. Waking, bathing, eating, dressing. Grays on grays. Automatic memory routines. Car to train to sidewalk, a line at the cafe, bored idling. Walk to the office, swipe in.

“Game face.”

Small talk and updates. Meetings. Planning. More talk. Shop talk, self talk. Talk about talk. 

“Just checking in.”

Fleeing down the back stairs to the corner, shuddering breath. Smoke and tremble. Go back in. Last meeting before lunch. Reprieve. Wait. 

“Can’t talk now.”

“Get someone new. Someone like me and you. Talk to me when you’re through.”
