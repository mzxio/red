### The line between times.

Not when all of one time ends and all of another begins, but when the usual cycles arrive at a predetermined point. A ratio of one time and another. An exact combination of  elements.

The dark cold time and the bright hot time, and points exactly in between. Times long honored since the first time standing precisely between two worlds, between the hot and cold, between the growing time and the resting time. 

An invisible moment of equilibrium.
