### What happened to the ones who washed away?

Did any survive, gone to a faraway place to start anew? Did they all die, bones scattered in the river, tumbled out to sea? Who will tell their story?

We survived the trials of floods and snow and drought and thunder but now the village is burning. Will we survive the test of flame? If we are all that’s left, what will be after us? No one will tell our stories.  The valley will reclaim our farms, the rains will chip away our walls. One day someone will upon this place and see no trace. 

Will anyone know of the harvest, when we received our blessing? Will they know anything of us? 

Can we stop the fire if we break ourselves upon it? Dredge the river to throw it upon the ravenous flames. Senselessly devouring, without thought. What else is there to do? What else but to try? 

Even the floods couldn’t save us now. No one will talk about us. No one will remember.

Tonight we must beat the fire. There is no other way.
