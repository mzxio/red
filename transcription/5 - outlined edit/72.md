### The place of trials.

Ruins of ancient cities too vast for anyone to build. Ancestors with their unknowable skills and secret wisdom. We find their remains but never know them as they were. Nothing but some stones standing where a sacred site once was. Maybe all we’re doing is looking at our future.

A hill overlooking the old town. Rolling farmlands. Bones from a forgotten battle, covering the hills far as can be seen. Guilty of whatever crimes, subject to whatever punishment. Here the justice was swift and grotesque. Victims of another sort. Bones, commingled shards of the accused.

“Who is without sin?”

Ancient legends tell of someone who died on a hill such as this, overlooking a town, whose death bought passage for everyone to a better place hereafter. Casting back, recalling fully, there is no reason I should stand here as the witness and not the accused. No ancient death absolved me of my sin. There is no reason for my bones to be intact while these forgotten souls crunch underfoot. These should be my bones. 

“We are all taken, no matter what.”
