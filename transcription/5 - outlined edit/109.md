### Perturbations in orbits.

What are the dynamics? Gravity, speed, velocity, over time. Where a body appears to be and where it is are two different things. Update calculations as necessary. Inaccurate answers are cheaper to calculate than accurate ones. Sometimes you don’t need high accuracy, when looking far away.

Closer, begin to observe differences between reality and estimation. Nothing is quite as it seems. Save some margin for corrections. It’s death if you miss. Intercepts are tricky and costly. Some approaches are impossible. Check the numbers. Stay patient, go slow if you can.
