### Perturbations in orbits. $

mechanics. what are the dynamics? interstellar spacecraft.

observing gravity. speed over time. where a body is and where it appears to be are two different things. update calculations again when you get close. inaccurate answers are simpler and less expensive than accurate ones. sometimes you don’t need high accuracy, when you’re still far away.

getting closer, see the difference between reality and estimation. nothing is quite as it seems. save some fuel for last minute course corrections. if you’re going too fast and you fly off into the void that’s (your) own problem. intercepts are tricky and costly. sometimes impossible.

check your math. no one is coming to save you if you miss. trust the numbers. stay patient and go slow if you’re not sure. if it all goes wrong, don’t worry. someone may pick you up, in a million years or so.
