### Didn’t have to work alone.

Weeks getting ready. The last ones left. We cleared away the debris. Put up a new dome one layer at a time. They do the work up high. Mostly they do alright.

`You're not climbing up there to fix it.`

After the dome, a new house.  Salvage from the old buildings. Plant seeds in the garden. 

Don’t remember the last thing fresh I ate. Long time ago. Before.

“How long before the first harvest?”
