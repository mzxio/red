### Not much time now.

Don’t have anywhere else to go. I came all this way. May as well go take a look. 

An old dome. So old that it fell down under its own weight. Broken. Whatever’s in there, broken too. 

This place was beautiful, once. Before the dome fell there was a garden here. Like summers back home. Airy houses with windows thrown wide, birds singing. Trees, plants, water. Music.

All frozen now. Dead, desiccated. Silent. 

Some of the dome stayed up. The rest crushed underneath. Impossible to say how old. Old enough. Markings worn away. This place must have belonged to someone. No one any more.

A forgotten oasis. There’s worse places to die. 

Guess I’ll search the houses. Maybe they left something I could use.
