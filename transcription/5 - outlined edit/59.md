### Revolutions are fought with ideas first.

When we were in the resistance we always had to watch ourselves and everyone around us. We didn’t gather in groups of more than three for long, not to raise suspicion. We didn’t write anything down. If we had to send messages, we talked of inconsequential things to distract the watchers.

Monitor everyone you know when they are close to you. Listen to conversations and take note of minor details. The most casual aside may hold a key to true intentions or loyalties. Allegiances shift quickly. Never assume anyone is on any side indefinitely. 

Above all, be careful how you spend money.  It it the shortest path to getting caught, or exposing others to danger. Beware generosity, anyone else’s or your own. 

Remember revolutions are fought first with ideas. You must treat ideas like any weapon. Keep them safe. Consider anyone who has ideas as armed.
