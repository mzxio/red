### No way to tell them they were wrong.

They all decided. They had their rules. Some of them just follow the rules. They called up the rules whenever they needed a reason, an excuse. if something was outside the rules that meant it was wrong, never that the rules were wrong.

Some tried to change the rules. The ones who didnâ€™t want the rules to change would attack them, kill them. All within the rules of course. The rules let them kill anyone they wanted, at any time, for any kind of reason. The rules were a force, powerful and slow. 

At their root the rules remained unchanging. They followed everyone around no matter where they went. They brought the rules along with them. When different rules came into conflict we fought.  The winners would make up new rules to punish the losers.

Little by little, the rules were all.
