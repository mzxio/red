### He walks into the bar.

He’s angry. Furious. Clutches a gun under his clothes. Two women are at the bar. They don’t see him. There, she is the one he’s here to kill. He walks behind her and pulls out the gun. He talks in angry broken sentences, a whisper at first then screaming and hoarse. 

He insists that she has betrayed him, taken all his money. Everyone in the bar is watching him. No one makes a sound. He waves the gun and screams at them to stay. He wants them to see, he wants them to listen. The other woman is calm. She gets his attention. 

“Hey, hey. Are you sure about this? Have you thought this through? Is this really what you want?” 

He screams more. Of course this is what he wants. 

“Last chance. Walk away.”

He points the gun. Then he disappears. Everyone else is gone, all but the two women and the bartender. He takes away the glasses. She is shaking and rooted, glassy eyes. 

“What happened? Where did he go?”

“He was going to hurt you. I removed him. I cannot reconstitute him now. He won’t ever hurt you.”
