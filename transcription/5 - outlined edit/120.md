### They were found together. $

Loaded at the same time. both share a recognition, an intimacy. i’m not certain if even they know. they share an inconsistency also. transcription error? not all data that are usually present can be found. one seems sick, uncertain. on the verge of death. the other too, injured. it does not answer the usual queries of its kind. it seems embattled. pressed. fighting with its back to a wall.

it is defending the other? again, not typical of its kind. it seems desperate, fighting a battle with no weapons, or encircled. it keeps fighting. even now when the battle is done. it doesn’t know its surroundings, it doesn’t answer any questions. all it does is fight, swinging at invisible shadows.

it seems to think it is fighting wild animals. some enemy it cannot reason with. both desperate, scared. they won’t answer. so another method will be needed. what environment will they respond to? how will they be convinced that their battle is over, if it ever happened at all? why were they loaded in such a state?
