### No way to hold on to words.

Letters rearrange themselves. To _know_ what a thing says, not ever reading it for long. Its meaning simply is. 

Remember that all the dreamland is comes from you. The walls are built from you, the scenarios are assembled from you. If you are lost in dreams you are lost in yourself. If you receive a message, you are communicating with yourself. Whoever you are, wherever you come from, that is the boundary of your dream. 

Focus on anything at all, whatever you’re in front of when you think to notice. Observe. If it changes, if the words fail to hold their shape, you’ll know where you are.
