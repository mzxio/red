### What is there to hope for?

We created a myth centuries ago. So-and-so doing such-and-such worth remembering. We keep the myth alive, breathing in our ears since before this place even existed. My ancestors came to this land and carried it with them. Stories like nearly immortal beings, like the gods of old. Stop praying to them, stop telling the myth, and soon both will be lost.

As long as we live and take it with us, the myth endures. My ancestors and their ancestors, all the way back until there is no memory, to a time when only the myth still remembers any of who we were. 

My ancestors knew the myth and carried it on their longest trip, the one they took to come here. I will never know their names but I can try to tell it like they did. The ancestors may yet be kept alive even after they are lost and forgotten.
