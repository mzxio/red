### Did you mean what you said?

You said a hateful thing and said you didn’t hate. Before you’d asked the question, you answered it with your actions. Did you know? Now we can never know.

You can’t act with hatefulness and disavow hate. Own it as you would anything else. You, your choice, your doing. When you were alone together, when you killed, that was your choice. That was your hate.

What could have been is gone, what’s left is broken beyond repair. Even infinite after is no comfort.

It was so cold that night. Full moon over the shore. You held my hand.

“You exist here.”

“No.”
