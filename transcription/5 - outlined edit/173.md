### We were always dead.

I was dead before you brought us here. You died when you tried to change the way things were. This whole time we were dead. I knew it but you never did. You were holding on to this idea that you could bring me back, like you could protect me from the darkness.

“You’re so sweet. Such a beautiful idiot.”

So young. We never had a chance to learn before. Now you could have a life if you want to, but you don’t. You hitched yourself to me. Undead. Ghosts haunting this place as long as you kept me here. You may love me now, but you never knew me. Just my ghost.

“I wish I could be alive for you. I wish you could save me the way you wanted to. But it’s too late. We are dead. We should go to our rest.”
