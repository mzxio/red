### The same, again and again.

Escaping lockdown. Wet woods. Empty farm house. No power, no connection, no way to call out.

Running. Stuck in mud. Sliding down hills. Digging in leaves. Long dress. It gets caught. The road, the trucks, the men. Back to lockdown.

Blue light in the darkness. Accelerating. Crushed. A fractal tower. Vehicles. one carries a secret, one will be escape. The column moves, all the vehicles shift, there are never any fewer. they go on forever. None contain the secret. 

“Grab one and go. Get out.”

Forever darkness. Howling wind. Broken on the rocks. The wind isn’t howling, it’s creatures in the night, beyond the light from the fire.

Can’t move. They come closer. Howls upon howls. They want to kill. They are hungry. They’ll eat me alive.

She appears, a stick held up, flaming, swinging at the creatures. Starving and feral, giant and terrible. She has her back to me. I can’t see her face. 

She fights them, driving them away.
