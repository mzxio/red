### What if it was us?

What if somehow it all came down to us the water’s edge? Walking apart or staying together? Wrecking any other chance but what came to pass. Not just for the one or the two but for all? Is that even possible?

“Would you know? Would anyone know?”

Does the death inside and the death outside have a different origin, and they came to fruition at the same time? Am I a reflection of it, or is it a reflection of me?  Not that we can go back and fix it, for us or for them. Still, what if it was us?
