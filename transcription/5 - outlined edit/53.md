### Those who can’t see the sun. 

Work every day in a building with no windows. A job they know won’t last. As soon as their bosses figure out how to replace them, they will be gone. Already a shadow of an automaton, following procedures and scripts and rules. 

Sit in the chair. Don’t move. Work when the tone sounds. Follow the script. Keep them on the line. Make it up as you go. No more than a few seconds of dead air. Send them into oblivion, transferred to a dead extension.  Before you do, make sure to sell them something. Close more deals. Get more perks.

“This call will be monitored and recorded for quality assurance.”

Schedule calculated to a precision within one second. Moments precisely regulated. Unscheduled disconnection is grounds for termination. Green light, red light. Flooding. When the event starts, the flood. Flowing toward where there’s no sun, a thousand miles away or more. Talking about the weather with someone who doesn’t want to talk.
