### Those who can’t see the sun. $

the ones who work every day in a building with no windows. who do  a job they know won’t last. as soon as the bosses figure out how to replace them, they will. already just an automaton, following rules and scripts and procedures. 

sit in the chair. don’t move. when the beep comes, you go to work. follow the script. the fat book of guides won’t have any relevance at all. make it up as you go. send the caller into oblivion, transferred to a dead extension. keep them on the line. no more than a few seconds of dead air. sell them something. close deals. you will be monitored.

your schedule calculated down to less than a second. your moments precisely regulated. an unscheduled bathroom break is grounds for dismissal. green light, red light. keep your little perks if you do well enough and the calls aren’t flooding in.

when the rain comes or the special event starts, get ready for the flood. no sun, a thousand miles away or more, talking about the weather with someone who doesn’t want to talk.
