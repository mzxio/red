### Wrecks all up and down the coast.

The current pulls them here. From who knows where. Old shipping lanes, far away. Used to be more. Now there are just a few. Most of them already came.

How many out there drifting to us? We took the ones we could get. Some there’s no getting. Stuck on reefs and rocky bays. Currents too strong. Not worth dying for. They’ve been adrift too long. Sometimes they come like someone got there first.

Some places blackened and died from whatever juices the corpses leaked. The wrecks are cursed. These dead ships, spared from the conflagration, but not the long slow death after.

_So they come here._
