### Survival isnâ€™t governed by fitness.

There is no supernatural or divine force at work in who lives or dies. Fitness, adaptation, suitability, those things play out over time. In each life, fitness is just a chance at solving certain kinds of problems. 

There is no magic key. No final judgement. Justice falls to uncertainty. Chance holds more sway than righteousness or fitness. Adaptability, determination, cooperation, some competition, all only improve your chances. They will not change fate.

Some live, some die. What can we learn from that? Nothing. Everything. We evolve. Death is as relevant as life.
