### Survival isnâ€™t governed by fitness.

Some live, some die. What can we learn from that? Nothing. Everything. We change. 

Fitness, adaptability, determination, cooperation, competition, nothing beats fate. There is no final revelation, no ultimate judgement. Justice falls to uncertainty. Chance holds sway over righteousness and fitness the same. 

Death is as relevant as life.
