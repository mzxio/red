### No way for memories to provide sustenance.

You cannot eat the memory of a fruit and receive nourishment, no matter how sweet that memory is. Don’t feast on fruits that can never provide. Never feed, never heal. 

If all you can do is remember others, important pieces will be missing. Reminiscences, recollections of people or places or times.  Nothing alive to be found there. A depiction of what’s been lost, breath rattling in a shallow simulacra.

“Reflections in broken glass.”

To remember the dead is to animate their ghosts. To remember the living fragments their spirit, separating who they were from who they are for themselves from who they are to you. Can any one fragment contain their true being?

“We may be children of the infinite, but we are beings of the present.”
