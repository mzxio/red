### Sometimes all I see is hallways.

Some old building. Abandoned, repurposed.

Walking the halls. People know me. Friendly voices, imagined faces. It doesnâ€™t hold. 

Just architecture, just halls. Changing, folding, recombining. 

Whatever they are disappears behind, reconstitutes in front. Just out of view.
