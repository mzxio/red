### Snow days.

In the white and dreary sky, the blowing snow drifting, piling up. Marks where people have passed, long pristine untouched yards. Plump outlines softening hard shapes.

The quiet and the steam and the tinkling of snow on the wind. Snow whipped this way and then that, scattered over the windows, Precarious piles on slender branches of bare trees, stuck to every protrusion. Just enough to hold one, then ten, then ten thousand. Soft easy curves gathering up in the corners.

Deep places hiding, you donâ€™t see until you step in them. Walking in the blowing cold and wet, blinded by every surface. Luminous, white with some little edges. Nowhere is exactly the same. 

White turns to gray and mush. Icy moats drifting in blackened puddles. Melt and freeze and melt until what little remains sublimates back to the sky. 

Before all that, quiet. Still. Snow day.
