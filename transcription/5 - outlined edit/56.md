### Snow days. $

in the white and dreary sky and the blowing snow drifting, piling up. the marks where people have been, the long pristine yards untouched. plumping up every surface. puffy cars, puffy roots.

the quiet and the steam and the tinkling of the snow on the wind. the snow whipped this way and then that, to scatter over the windows, making precarious piles on the slender branches of bare trees, stuck to everything even mildly protruding and horizontal. just enough to hold one, then ten, then ten thousand. soft easy curves gathering up in the corners.

deep places you donâ€™t see until you step in them. walking in the blowing cold and wet, snowblind by every luminous surface. everything is white with some details. some little edges poking out. nowhere is exactly the same. an uneven distribution.

 white turns to gray and mush, icy moats drifting in blackened puddles. melt and freeze and melt until what little remains sublimates back to the sky. 

before all that, quiet stillness. snow day.
