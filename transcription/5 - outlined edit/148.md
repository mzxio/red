### We came too far to turn back now. $

driving, driving.
west. east. encircled.
the loop closes, the noose closes. tightens, squeezed.
choking out life, new growth. adding new life too, the scars breed organisms that sicken and grow. leaves us addicted, hooked. craving more. more loops, more connection, more nooses, strangling without us even knowing until it’s too late. they said it would usher in a new era, and they were right. they said we were at the apex of history, that we stood on the shoulders of all who came before. maybe that was right too. as the noose tightens even our ancestors can’t save us.
