### We came too far to turn back now.

Going, going.

Encircled.

The noose closes. Tightens, squeezed.

Choking out life, new growth. 

Scars breed organisms that sicken and grow.

Addicted, hooked. Craving more.

They said that we stood on the shoulders of all who came before.

Even our ancestors canâ€™t save us.
