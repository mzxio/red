### The history they tell you isn’t yours.

It’s their history. It’s the history that they made up. The way they want you to think it happened. Their excuses. Whatever doesn’t fit, discarded. Any story outside theirs, unworthy. Unless it serves them. 

It is in their interests to transform us into savage animals. Beasts who attack in the night and kill families while they sleep. That’s what they did to us. We lived here for an age before they came. Will they last as long? No. 

Their way is ravenous, destructive. They will strip the land of all its riches and move on, leaving us with whatever is left. They are the savages, the beasts of civilization. They say their way is best. They say we should be like them. But I see what civilized people do, who they are. They are nothing to be revered.
