### Here no one knows me.

Press of bodies, loose and tight. Horns honk. Tires wheeze on ragged pavement. Deliveries delivered.  Bloodshot-faced moneymakers boisterously outdoing each other at the corners. Snowy mist rolling in. Cold wind. Passerby clutch jackets to themselves. Eyes averted.

Some invisibility works because others wish you to be invisible. To any who pay attention, this falls apart. Failing certain checks transforms anyone into a deviation. Miscreant. Shameful, ignored, ground underfoot. From unseen to frightening. 

Invisibility in the city gathers aspects from above and below. Find middle, average. Gray. Mystery is a dangerous courtship. Powers to be used with care. Adopt a friendly manner. Guide conversation without threat. Say little. 

The few who notice will forget soon enough.

“They make up their own minds.”
