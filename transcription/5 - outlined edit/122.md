### Nothing flat. $

the odors creep in. faceless people. changing at a whim. skin from rough to smooth to thin to thick. faces, expressions. body thick to slender. hair light, dark. eyes into focus. changing. changing even as they move. coming closer, touching. rising. falling. the embrace. inescapable. as is the changing. choosing. they become as you choose, as you desire.

what is this? how did i come here?

 i should be more scared but itâ€™s a turn-on. they change as i think. i change them. why? this place. i see only one of those beings. why does it pursue me? what does it want? or does it only reflect what i want? what do i want? if i let it get close enough maybe it will tell me. but then there will be no escape. 

do i let it come closer?
