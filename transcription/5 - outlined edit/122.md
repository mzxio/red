### Nothing flat.

Odors creep in. Faceless people, changing at a whim. Skin from rough to smooth to old to young. Faces, expressions. Bodies thick to slender. Hair light, dark, short, long. Eyes into focus. Changing. Flickering even as they move. 

Coming closer, touching. Rising. falling. the embrace. Inescapable. The changing. Choosing. They become as you choose, as you desire.

“What is this?”

They change as I think.  I should be more scared but it’s a turn-on. I change them with my desires. Why? I see only one. Why is it here? What does it want? Or does it only reflect what I want? What do I want? If I let it get close enough maybe it will tell me, but then there will be no escape.
