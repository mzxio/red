### The city begins.

A plain between mountains, near the sea.

Draw one line from the idealized center of the land to the sea. Other lines connect the mountains, the passages through the hills. At the nodes where those lines connect, build the first settlements. Homes, markets, churches, warehouses. Draw more lines connecting structures. Every time one line runs over another they become bolder, wider.

Settlements swell. More people move in. Side streets become arterial roads. A core district springs up from one old village, overlaying new geometry that doesnâ€™t quite fit the land. Interference patterns over generations of building and demolishing.

The first towns all grow together. The core district becomes denser, taller. The city sprawls across the whole valley. Farms and estates take over the hills. The sprawl finally reaches the sea. The city reaches its maximum footprint.

A fire rips through an old district. It is rebuilt, but never the same. And so it goes. The city eats itself and grows itself anew. Constantly dying and reborn from the ruins. The city prospers, rich and vibrant. Almost no sign of the original settlement remains by the end of the beginning. 

`Now it is time.`
