### Always in a hurry.

Get somewhere, get something. Get it done, get it in, get on to the next thing. Always a rush to the finish. Even procrastinators hurry in their aimlessness, hurrying to do anything except whatever needs doing. 

Do it all, do it not at all, but get to it. Rushing days, hasty nights. Appointments and schedules, time slices stacked. Time wasted. Rush to get a hit of information streamed into minds and ears and eyes.

If the stream breaks, rush to get it fixed. Make sure it’s somebody else’s problem. If you can’t, rush to  make them rush for you. Now now now.

It was not always so. They always say that. I can’t seem to rush now. Doing it fast isn’t in me as the sun creeps over the horizon and today is here.
