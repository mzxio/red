### What is left?

Limbo. Throwing sticks, rolling bones. Augurs and signs. Divination of the rocks. Heaven, earth, fire, water, mountain, wind, thunder, lake. Ancient elements. An old computer transmitted with abstract design over tenuous connections. Fragments of essential pieces, recompiled imperfectly and revised for millennia.

The philosophers who studied their whole lives didn’t know for sure. They changed their minds more than once over the centuries, revising history to erase any evidence of uncertainty. Later philosophers didn’t even know. They labored under false impressions until even more was discovered. Little by little they came to their own understanding. When they died another generation forgot.

On and on they went until the ultimate forgetting, when even the philosophers came close enough to the divine to at last pinpoint its source.
