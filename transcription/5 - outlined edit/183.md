### What is left?

Limbo. Throwing sticks, rolling bones. Augurs and signs. Divination of the rocks. Heaven, earth, fire, water, mountain, wind, thunder, lake. Ancient elements. An old design transmitted in abstract over tenuous connections. Fragments of essential pieces, imperfectly recompiled and revised.

The philosophers who studied their whole lives didnâ€™t know for sure. They changed their minds more than once over the centuries, revising history of uncertainty. Later philosophers labored under false impressions, until even more discoveries were made. They each came to their own understanding. 

When they died another generation forgot. On and on they went until the ultimate forgetting, when even the philosophers came close enough to at last pinpoint its source.
