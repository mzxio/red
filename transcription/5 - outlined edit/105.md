### We were the survivors.

Not the ones that anyone cared about. Not the special ones. Not the princes and princesses, not the leaders, not the nobles. We walked around the edges, stood at the back, kept quiet.

Until we didn’t. Then there were a few of us. Some of us picked the losing side in a conflict and they were gone. They may have been right but they lost anyway. I secretly wished I was brave enough to be one of them.

Then we were few. I gained the leaders’ respect and they afforded us some indulgences. Shelter, equipment, weapons. We became the guard, serving their interests. I set up watches. I had a good second-in-command. We marched, endlessly moving, ground and sky. 

It all went wrong. 

So hard to remember now. She was there and then she wasn’t. She walked out of her quarters when no one was looking and never came back. I know she was killed. How? I don’t know. Someone killed her. One of the nobles. Had to be. They wanted us all dead. 

After I watched the uprising, the purge, I couldn’t let it continue. Then that’s all I did. Watch. Talk big talk. We made it until we didn’t. 

The guard continued. Instead of taking over ruins we built our own places. 

Still after she was gone it was never the same. Not for me. We were just survivors.
