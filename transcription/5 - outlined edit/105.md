### We were the survivors.

Not the ones that anyone cared about. Not the special ones. Not the princes and princesses, not the leaders, not the nobles. We walked around the edges, stood at the back, kept quiet.

Until we didn’t. Then there were a few of us. Some of us picked the losing side in a conflict and they were gone. They may have been right but they lost anyway. I secretly wished I was brave enough to be one of them.

Then we were few. I gained the leaders’ respect and they afforded us some indulgences. Shelter, equipment, weapons. We became their guard, serving their interests. I had a good second. We marched, endlessly moving, ground and sky. 

_It all went wrong._

She was there and then she wasn’t. She walked out when no one was looking and never came back. I know she was killed. How? I can’t know for sure. But someone killed her. One of the others. Had to be. They wanted us all dead. 

After she was gone it was never the same. I watched the uprising, the purge. All I did was watch. Talk big. We made it until we didn’t have to anymore. Instead of taking over old places we built our own. Not for me. We were just survivors.
