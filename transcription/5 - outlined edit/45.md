### Walking slow.

Going carefully. Saving energy. Looking out for safety.

Hunger, thirst, warmth, cold. Food and water in. Heat in. Time out. Rest, sleep, pause. Don’t wait too long. The sun is always moving.

The animals can smell fear, circling when they sense your weakness. Kill or be killed. Don’t let them get you first. 

The cold is always coming. Wait until the sun goes down. Make sure you get inside. The dark will kill you fastest. There is no way out but you can still make a fire.
