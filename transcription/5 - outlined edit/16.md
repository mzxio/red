### Burning wreckage.

Smoke rising. An undisturbed column in the windless sky. A timeless place. Still if not for shadows moving, tracks on the ground. Only pale hills and sun. 

The wreck is too hot to touch. Something in the ground made it burn. Fire and ice. Looks like it could burn for a while. Could burn forever. No way to tell.

What came free? Broadcasting. No one will ever hear. Too much noise. Last telemetry. Even in death it shows what it saw on the come down. Long walk. Could be here after all.

“Guess this is it.”
