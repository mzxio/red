### Transitioning from one state to another.

Navigating a sluggish course on a swift current. Yesterday is gone but we live. Move along, nothing left to see here. Force out the ritual words, coerce and lay them down. Pretend for good. 

Parading corpses of defeated opponents through the streets. Come out to throw stones at the desiccated king of evil, make crude remarks about the broken disfigured queen. The ancient streets with their markets, looked upon by high dignitaries. Tang of death and shit, constant on the wind. 

Outsiders coming from away. Villages gone. Flooded, burned, looted, abandoned, lying fallow. Enemies came, burned down the city down and slaughtered everyone. As if from the roots the city grows again, then begets an army that destroys its enemies. Decimated, assimilated.

Here we are. Gruesome displays of victory. Indulgence. The damned all jeer. Today the enemies are beaten, their lands lie fallow now too. Us and them is all. 

Leave the markets and head for the hills. Don’t look long upon the dead displayed upon the walls. Soon we’ll all know what it is to be so far beyond reach.
