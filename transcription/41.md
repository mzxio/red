we never really knew each other at all, did we? i never could get you to listen. you never could get me to understand. i still feel betrayed. guessing that you do too. but the dream of it, the sense of us, i could never shake that. the more i remember, the longer i spend looking back, the more cracks i see. the more i know why everything fell apart. and i’m so mad you wouldn’t listen, that you pushed on ahead when i told you to stop. that you had the nerve to call me all (these/those) things afterward, that you forced me to hold your flood but a few drops of me was too much. mostly i’m mad at myself for falling so hard for you. and this unshakeable feeling that (you’re/you were) worth it and there was nothing i could ever do. 

the hills were dark and rich and fragrant and you said such sweet words and i was glad to know you, to know someone else who loved those hills and craved to make those unrealities real. the smokers and floor-sleepers, the idle dreamers and wishers. seers of the unseen, listeners of the unheard. the weirdos and poets and photographers. my kin. why wasn’t it enough?
