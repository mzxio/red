(diagram omitted: “how do you break identity?”)

ego holds on to self so tight. if i die, it says, you die too. maybe that’s true, maybe not. does the flower need an ego? does the blade of grass or grain of sand? all around i see many things and only a few egos. that quintessence of identity. the unique id assigned to a value in some vast unsorted index. ego. ego is me. but i am not my ego. remove the ego, do i cease to be? maybe i stop being human only. maybe without it i am just wetware, squishy brain driving squishy meat. no ego. would that mean i couldn’t differentiate myself from the flowers and the grass and the sand? is ego nothing but a focal point and a lens through which to view the world?
