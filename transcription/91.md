whatever it is, gone now. the thought, the sense, the memory. there was something, i know it. and at the moment of waking, when it could have taken on a life of its own, snuffed out. nothing. just these desperate notes, shallow words trying to give shape to the shapeless, to make plans for the future. what i know today i will forget and i can’t trust future self to read the notes as soon as they’re written. keep no records, just go with whatever small amount makes it through one moment to the next. but then nothing big ever happens deliberately, nothing substantial is built. just little shacks and hovels instead of mansions or skyscrapers. keep forgetting and relearning, going round and around wasting time, repeating all the past mistakes, resolving problems that already had solutions. forget it all, drop it all, leave it all, until the next time you find it. walking in circles without a map or memory.
