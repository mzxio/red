how did it come to this? those things we made for ourselves, why did we make them so wrong? i think about my own mistakes and multiply by 7,000,000,000 and it starts to make sense. i wonder if i have made more or fewer mistakes than the average. and they pile up like mountains of trash blowing in the streets, choking the sky, strangling the sea. 

i used to think i wanted to leave this rock but now i don’t think so. or maybe i want us to leave it in peace, let her heal. we die, we leave, we send a piece of ourselves. i would rather see a thousand seeds, this is a legacy of a place called earth. but what i no longer see is any capacity for humans to change. our stupid shit is too great. maybe earth humans are dumb and mars humans or titan humans will be better. maybe there’s hope. 

will we fuck up our new home as much as our old home?

i care more about the earth with all her children than i do about the people.

the old ways have new shapes but it’s still the same.
