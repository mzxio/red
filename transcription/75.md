the universe is pockmarked with holes. cracked and fragmented, uneven, irregular. fall through any one of those irregularities and there’s no telling where you might end up. other domains intersect wherever you happen to be right now. you could end up in one of them by accident. you may never even perceive the crack you slip through. a hole can open up under your feet and you could fall to somewhere without any apparent motion. these shifting crystalline spaces are constantly rearranging themselves. nothing stays static for long. you can learn to detect these changes with time and experience, if you don’t already possess the skill. the sense is at the edge of the usual feelings that come in any normal day. deja vu, and falling without moving. the sudden trip on nothing, a sense of unfamiliarity with what should be known. a confusion or sense of disconnection, especially with no apparent reason. watch these senses, develop them. sometimes they come from something inside. sometimes they indicate that you have traveled to a different domain.
