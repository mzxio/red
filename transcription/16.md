nobody noticed when the world ended.

they laughed and drank and sang in the bars. they chatted and read and smiled in cafes. they bought books and clothes and jewelry, glossy phones, new cars, groceries and shoes and novelty mugs. they walked with crinkling bags held close; takeout, lunch, dinner. table for two, four, six, eight. two by two they came, but not us. we were one by one, nothing, a fragment, an expression of a shattered line. in continuous. the world ended and the world just kept going. no one else ever noticed. 

crossing into the other domain.

the terminus. yesterday becomes a different yesterday. tomorrow is the same as it ever was. it all collapses.

time traveling. folding the universes into one. there is one observed domain, but sometimes i canâ€™t see it or forget.
