a salty inland sea, just like they talked about in scripture. between the hills, past the desert, in the trackless rocky wastes. brambles and other rugged stony plants, tough dry carapaced beings, some ugly weathered birds, but otherwise no life. this is where the sun and the earth have more agency than any living being. and the salty sea, landlocked, toxic. desiccated corpses of plants and animals white and ghostly, frozen at the water’s edge. the scriptures say the hermit passed this way, centuries ago. they say the hermit tried to commit suicide by drowning, but couldn’t stay under and breathe in the water. they say the mother made the water salty to keep the hermit alive, that she left the salt as a reminder to us that her grace is in us all. maybe that’s true, but all i see is the water and the desolation beyond. who knows what his in the brush. if i follow the scripture i should walk between the two peaks and continue toward the rising sun in the morning for 20 days. or is that in the old calendar? which two peaks? was there ever a hermit out here at all? what am i doing here?
