### No way to tell them they were wrong.

they all decided. they had their rules. some of them just follow the rules because they are the rules. mostly they called up the rules whenever they needed a reason, an excuse. if something as outside the rules that meant it was wrong, never that the rules were wrong. some people tried to change the rules and the ones who didn’t want the rules to change would attack them, kill them. all within the rules of course. the rules let them kill anyone they wanted, at any time, for any number of reasons. the rules themselves became a force, powerful and slow like a mountain moving an inch at a time. sometimes something big would happen and the rules would change one way or another, for a little while. but the rules were always there, at their root unchanging. they followed everyone around no matter where we went. we brought the rules with us. when people didn’t have rules like ours we fought, made them take our rules (as) their own. little by little, the rules were us.
