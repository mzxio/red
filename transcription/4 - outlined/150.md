### Ways to bring the fire

With little else but harmony between air and fuel — combustion. The best combustion gives the best fire, the most heat, the fastest cooking. ancient ideas, whatever technology. build an oven with sand and water, make the mud, make the clay. use bricks salvaged from the old world. stones mortared carefully together. if all else fails, use the old log. draw in the air, the fire pulls it through even the smallest spaces. control the flow, control the burn. it doesn’t take much. just some sticks. clean up the old growth, piles from the forest floor. let the wind do its job. the stove is just the shelter, the enclosure. make it to whatever your specifications. the lady in the woods said this is how she makes her beans, it’s easier and faster than the stoves that rely on someone else’s resources, gasses stolen from the earth. build one of these and you’ll never go cold.
