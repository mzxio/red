### We miscounted.

Days and nights with no clocks, no calendars. We lost track. 

You ask how long it’s been. We don’t know. Some time.

One of the ancient legends tells of pilgrims walking for years in the desert looking for their new home. More than one legend. How well did they keep track of time? The people who used to live here left stones along the road. In the day, at dawn, if you stand at the stones they cast a shadow just so. If you can read them, the stones tell you exact day, season. Stones say how long it’s been, if you remember to look.

We didn’t always know about the stones. Before we just counted the days. sometimes we forgot and marked too few days, too many. Now we know about the stones. We are learning better how to count the days. 

Not yet two years since the stones. How long did we walk before?
