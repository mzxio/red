### On the runway.

Sun low against the horizon. We stop, we go, we wait. Rest. Lean back.

“Wait.”

In line. White and blue livery in front. White and yellow after. They go. We’re up next. Make the turn.

Breathe deep. Stink of human bodies and solvents and greasy recycled air. 

“Flight attendants, prepare for takeoff.”

Kick the plane into gear. Bass. Wings shudder. Rumbling on the asphalt. Quaking, veering from side to side. Pulling only a little in the breeze.

Weightless.

Ground drops away. No more crude rubber on dirt. Pull up the gear. Come out on a long lazy curve over the water. Light sweeps through the cabin, sparkling on the wings. The city wheels behind, under. Chasing twilight, toward the mountains and the desert.

Breathe another breath.

“It’s now safe to use those electronic devices.”
