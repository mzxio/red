### Equipment failure.
  
Slow degradation of time. All things physical that live eventually die. Disconnected.

Radiation, collision, accidents. One failure begets another. Eventually there can be no travel, only certainty of death before reaching the next destination. 

Carrying life through dangerous places. Every step taken for its preservation. The carrier takes damage to preserve its cargo. The journey has no other purpose. The carrier knows of its own inevitable death and carries on for the hope and certainty of finding a place to rest, to lay down its burdens, to let the life it shelters flourish and grow. Without the same fears, without the same trials. Without burning and the scarring and the long grinding eternity between the stars.

Eventually the carrier comes to the final question: stop here, or try for there? Here is less than ideal but it may never survive the trip to there. If it dies between here and there all life with it will die too. 

So it makes a choice.
