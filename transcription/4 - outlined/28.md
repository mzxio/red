### No patience, gluttonous.

Filling empty spaces with unfulfilling things. Chasing even more. 

“There’s no filling the holes, just makes new ones that have to be filled later on.”

Consume less. Be patient. Reaction is what all objects do, introspection is something that thinking beings can undertake. 

Wait, think, act. Stand away. Evaluate value and risk, cause and effect.

Leave with only the consequences.
