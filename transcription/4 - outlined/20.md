### Ego holds on to self so tight.

“If I die, you die too.”

Maybe that’s true, maybe not.

Does the flower need an ego? Does a blade of grass or a grain of sand? All around I see many things and only a few egos. Is it truly the quintessence of identity? The unique identity assigned to a value in some vast index of all that is? 

Ego. 

Remove my ego, do I cease to be? Maybe I stop being human only. Maybe without it I am just wetware. Squishy brain driving squishy meat. Ego is me, but I am not my ego.

No ego. 

Would that mean I couldn’t differentiate myself from the flowers and the grass and the sand? Is ego nothing but a focal point and a lens through which to view the world?

“How do you break identity?”
