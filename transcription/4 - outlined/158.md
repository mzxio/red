### They stayed inside when the rains came.

Nothing much serious needed doing. From under eaves, through windows, they watched. Rain fell on the fields, on the hills. The river swelled with silt and foam, swirling debris washed away. It rained all day and all night and into the next day. Smith’s forge and potter’s kiln steamed billowy clouds of steam. The houses smoked. 

Everyone huddled together in their halls, drinking and eating, laughing and talking and sulking. The farmers were sour that they couldn’t get anything done. Children played and shrieked and ran underfoot. It was an early spring and most welcome.

The rain stopped on the third evening. Heavy mist rising from the fields in the late afternoon light, purple and blue and orange. One farmer’s barn had washed away and some animals were lost. Everyone got together in the gathering night, with sticks and lanterns, and went out looking for the creatures.

All but one were found, washed into sandy banks on the river in the tumult. Another farmer shared their barn. Together they gathered up the animals safe inside. 

Midnight came and the village slept, waiting for the next dawn, when the fields would come alive once more.
