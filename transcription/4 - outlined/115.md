### Whatever was here before, gone now.

Nothing but rock and ruin, decimated by the wind and the rain and the swift seasons. tales of ancient greats, the ones who came here before. First? Who was first? Who will be last? 

I am not the first. I am not the last. They were here before me. Someone will be along soon after. For now it’s just me and the ghosts, a hand full of sand.

What’s the significance of this place? They say there was an entire city here but these columns are all that remain. An important meeting was held here. The fate of many were sealed at the end of a long war. Neighbors struggling, killing, dying. They decided to stop, for whatever reasons. This is where they stopped it. 

What ceremony did they perform? Did they lay down their weapons at the entrance and then walk inside? Did they bow or kneel or sign? Did they know that later there would just be other wars? That this place would be destroyed at the end of their old order? 

The ghosts are full of grief and knowing. They were here at the very beginning. They will be here after the end. Maybe they are the ones who will be last.
