### Snow days.

in the white and dreary sky and the blowing snow drifting, piling up. the marks where people have been, the long pristine yards untouched. plumping up every surface. puffy cars, puffy roots. the quiet and the steam and the tinkling of the snow on the wind. the snow whipped this way and then that, to scatter over the windows, making precarious piles on the slender branches of bare trees, stuck to everything even mildly protruding and horizontal. just enough to hold one lake, then ten, then ten thousand. soft easy curves gathering up in the corners, the deep places you donâ€™t see until you step in them. walking in the blowing cold and wet, snowblind by every luminous surface. everything is white with some details. some little edges poking out. nowhere is exactly the same. an uneven distribution. then the scraping of cars, the dragging of ploughs, pushing forward in hissing and bumping on the roads. the white turns to gray and mush, icy moats drifting in blackened puddles, also deeper than you realize until you step in them. melt-freeze-melt-freeze, what little remains will sublimate back to the sky, after a while lurking in shadows and in the deep piles thrown up by this shovel of that snowblower. before all that, a quiet stillness. snow day.
