### Didn’t have to work alone.

Weeks getting ready. The ones before left help. I activated them all. We cleared away the debris. Put up a new dome one layer at a time. 

The bots do the work up high. They mostly got it right. 

`YOU'RE NOT CLIMBING UP THERE TO FIX IT` 

After the dome, a new house.  Salvaged most of the old buildings. Planted seeds in the garden. Don’t remember the last thing fresh I ate. Long time ago. Before. How long before the first harvest?
