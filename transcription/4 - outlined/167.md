### Little by little, time takes it all.

First the smells, the sounds, the exact shape of things. Time leaves the feelings. It takes more. The shape of things change. Impossible to put the pieces back together. There’s no way to reconstruct an exact scene. Artifacts break, degrade, get lost. All of it ends up as trash at the wayside. 

Eventually only the feeling remains, a wisp of old music recovered from some archived recording. Memory overwritten so many times that even its configuration, the arrangement, is in doubt. The smallest feeling now. Residual warmth in the heart from a sun long gone, a season past.

Anniversaries are the hardest. Swimming in feelings, drowning in what’s left of memory. Wishing for just one more moment.
