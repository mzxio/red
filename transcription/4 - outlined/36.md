### How can they decide?

if a venture to safeguard life doesn’t have the participation of life, what good is that venture? if they don’t know the stakes? “you must participate in your own salvation,” someone said. sacrifice is meaningless without an idea of why that sacrifice is being made, without a greater purpose. sacrifice for self only benefits self, and not for very long. sacrifice for other, for a cause, can go on to mean something forever, for as long as that cause lives, for as long as anyone remembers. if the cause is life itself it doesn’t matter if anyone remembers as long as there is life, that sacrifice will count for something. knowing how much there is to lose, how much could be gained, what the stakes are, all these add up to true mindful participation. true willing wholehearted sacrifice. the mother dies to feed her children,  knowing  when her time is done and the children will go on. so don’t hide the stakes, don’t obfuscate the depth of how bad things are or can get. embrace the actuality of your situation and speak it clear to anyone who can listen. when the stakes are high and time is running out, some will answer the call. they will help to bridge the precipice.
