### Burning, broken, scarred.

The last age. All the children have gone to sleep, awaiting their rebirth. For them it will be as if nothing happened. They will awaken and go about their lives as if it had always been so. All but a few.

My mistake, made so long ago. 

While everyone goes, they stay.

I brought them here without permission, tortured them for secrets. They were never supposed to be here, or anywhere but where they came from. I sense forgiveness now but I do not forgive. Itâ€™s been too long.

Our threads weave into a tapestry that only our children can ever view, even without knowing what it means. They carry who we were with who they become. I can only pray that we will prove adequate progenitors, us who stay behind.

We will watch the children from afar, for as long as we can.

I am spent, ruined. This birth has taken all that I was, all I could ever be. Soon we can rest. 

Not long now. The work is almost done.
