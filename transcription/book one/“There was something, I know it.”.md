### “There was something, I know it.”

Whatever it is, gone now. Walking in circles. No map or memory. Thought, sense, idea. Snuffed out at the moment of waking, when it could have taken on a life of its own. Now, nothing. Shallow shapes given to the shapeless. Making plans for the future. Can’t trust anyone from the future to ask.

Forget it all. Learn nothing. Until the next time.

Could just go only from one moment to the next. Keep no records. Nothing deliberate will ever happen. Repeat past mistakes, solve problems that already had solutions. Going round and round.

“What I know today I forget tomorrow unless I write it down.”
