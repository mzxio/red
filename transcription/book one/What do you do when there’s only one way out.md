### What do you do when there’s only one way out?

When that way is almost certain death? Here, soon, there won’t be a real me. No supplies. No air. Hours left. Dead, alone on whatever rock this is.

The pod still has power.

“What does that mean? Where will I go?”

Just as likely there’s no one listening and I’m sending myself to die out there too. The choice will make itself soon. I can stay and die as myself or leave a corpse in the pod and go on as a clone of who I was. 

No more dreams. Just let me go. Get it over with.

“I decided to stay.”
