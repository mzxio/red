“What do we take with us?”

Then isn’t all that different from now. The whole doesn’t change. Pieces realign. All the same. Destiny may have already chosen. It may not matter what you choose.

“If you don’t have a choice, what do you choose?“

“There is another way.”

Fly against destiny. Fly until there are no more choices. Fly headfirst into the void and fear no darkness. Fly and fly until the last of you is spent. Fly until words lose meaning and the old universe itself is nothing but a faint glow on the horizon.

Follow whatever you’re going to follow. Follow the tears, scattered on the wind. Follow the path set before you, glittering in the darkness. 

“Who would you be in any other time?”
