Always over the next ridge. What will I find when I get there, if I get there? Will there be anything left? 

“Maybe rest here.”

Log says it’s been so many hours, minutes, seconds, since the crash. What do those units count for now? Days and nights are different here. Watch the motion of the spheres. 

`You have arrived`

“Arrived, yes. Where?”

An old dome. Broken. Maybe it’s so old that it fell down under its own weight. Or something broke it. Whatever’s in there, broken too. May as well go take a look. I came all this way. Don’t have anywhere else to go.
