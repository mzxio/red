Walking in circles without a map or memory.

Whatever it is, gone now. There was something, I know it. Thought, sense, idea. Snuffed out at the moment of waking, when it could have taken on a life of its own. Now, nothing. Shallow shapes given to the shapeless. Making plans for the future.

What I know today I forget tomorrow unless I write it down. 

Canâ€™t trust anyone from the future to ask. Could just go only from one moment to the next. Keep no records. Then nothing deliberate will ever happen. Repeat all your past mistakes, re-solve problems that already had solutions. Going round and round, forgetting and learning again. 

Forget it all. Learn nothing. Until the next time.
