### What was the reason?

There was one. Reason. Why did we come here? Don’t remember now. It’s been so long. Don’t remember anything. Was there a time before? Was there anything else?

Once. There must have been. We weren’t always here. 

`Attacked.`

Who would have attacked? Nothing worth protecting but the dome. If they couldn’t fix it, would they kill for it?

“Can’t remember.”

Memory can’t be trusted. Illusion everywhere. Forgetting. It all runs together. Unending, once I forget the forgetting.
