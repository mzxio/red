### What is this place?

Elevator down. No numbers on the buttons, only colors. A long ride deep into the ground. Deep enough to lose signals from above. 

Levels of storage. Boxes going on and on. I haven’t looked in any of the boxes yet. All different sizes. No markings that I can read. Only symbols meant for scanners.

Maybe there’s supplies. Equipment. No reason not to look.

“They built this place to last.”

Whoever came here, they came correct. Thought they were going to stay. Enough supplies for a clan. Enough for many, enough for one. They left everything. 

How long have I been down here? Long enough. The air is fresh, recirculated. There’s food I can eat, and water. Seems like I could be here for a while.
