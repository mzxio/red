### Beautiful, once.

Before the dome fell there was a garden here. Must have been pleasant. Like summer back home. Airy homes with windows thrown wide, birds singing. Trees, plants, water. Music.

All frozen now. Dead, desiccated. Silent. 

Some the dome stayed up. The rest crushed houses underneath. Impossible to say how old. Old enough. Markings worn away. This place must have belonged to someone. Some or people or company or government.  No one any more.

A far away private oasis. There’s worse places to die. Guess I’ll search the houses. Maybe they left something I could use. 

Not much time now.
