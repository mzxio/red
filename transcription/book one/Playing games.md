### Playing games.

A grid of spaces. Players occupy one space each. Pieces can move to other spaces using special rules. They can be in the same space together, or interact with each other across spaces. Signals and weapons and what else?

The object of the game is survival. The winning state changes. You may survive by destroying all your opponents, or by reaching agreements with them, or by escaping. Who else is playing? 

Don’t do what the rules of the game tell you to do. The game isn’t what anybody tells you it is, it’s what you make of it. The game is just a set of pieces. You can move them however you please, assign any meaning you choose. Add your own pieces or take away old ones. We make up our own rules. Sometimes we use someone else’s rules. Other times there are no rules.

`Cycles within cycles.`

“There are layers of beings nested one within the other until there is no more.“

There is no plan, no way to win. Only loss, only death. Winning means going as long as possible without dying. Eventually we all lose. Revel in whatever comes your way. Be careful with resources. Embrace impermanence.

“Death is just a chance to begin again.”
