### Fires burning.

Smoke rising. An undisturbed column in the windless sky. Still if not for shadows moving, tracks on the ground. There is no time. Only hills, sun.  

The wreck is too hot to touch. Something in the ground made it burn. Fire ice. Looks like it could burn for a while. It could burn forever. No way to tell. Best get far away from here.

One pod thrown free. Supplies to last a little while. Still broadcasting a beacon. No one will ever hear the signal. Lost in too much radiation. Last telemetry. Scans.

Even though the ship is dead I can see what it saw when it came down. Shows a structure. Long walk from here. Could be someone lives here after all. Guess this is it. May as well try.
