### Weeks getting ready.


Didn’t have to do the work alone. 

The ones before left bots. We cleared away the debris. Put up a new dome one layer at a time. The bots do the work up high. They mostly got it right. I’m not climbing up there to fix it. 

After the dome, a new house.  Salvaged most of the old buildings. Planted seeds in the garden. How long before a harvest? Don’t remember the last thing fresh I ate. Long time ago. Before.
