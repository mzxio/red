### How much wreckage is out there?

Old junk left by long dead civilizations who walked themselves into oblivion. Spacefaring tribes, nomads of the stars, leaving their bodies along the way.

Running from world to world. Rock to cloud to sun.

What wars were fought? What were they fighting for, and who were they fighting? What junk was left twisted and broken, forgotten on some airless sphere?

If we ever found some lost scrap, would we even want to know? Would we recognize it? Or would it just be another remnant of ourselves? 

Nomad-kin finding bones of ancestors.
