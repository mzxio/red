### How much wreckage is out there?

Spacefaring tribes, running from world to world. Nomads of the stars. Bodies left along the way. Rock to cloud to sun.

Wars fought. Old junk left by long-dead civilizations who walked themselves into oblivion. Left twisted and broken, forgotten on some airless sphere. What were they fighting for, and who were they fighting? 

Nomad kin finding bones of ancestors. If we ever found some lost scrap, would we recognize it? Would it be a remnant of ourselves? Would we even want to know?
