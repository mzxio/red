### Going into an empty place to live alone forever.

Everyone else far away. A few weeks journey at least. Someone to visit once or twice a year and trade. Friends. One day there is no visit. They wait for an arrival and there is none. Eventually they forget.

Something kills us all. Some things kill us sooner if we don’t get help from someone else. The loners die early when they can’t get help to live. Solitude until the end. 

Years pass and the friends are old. Their children make the trip. For the first time on a dare, or retracing some forgotten old paths. Until they find the place. And that’s it. Some undignified corpse.

Maybe that’s me.
