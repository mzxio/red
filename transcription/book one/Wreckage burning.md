### Wreckage burning.

Smoke rising. An undisturbed column in the windless sky. A timeless place. Still if not for shadows moving, tracks on the ground. Only pale hills, sun. 

The wreck is too hot to touch. Something in the ground made it burn. Fire ice. Looks like it could burn for a while. It could burn forever. No way to tell.

Best get far away from here.

One pod thrown free. Could have supplies to last a while. Still broadcasting a beacon. No one will ever hear the signal. Too much radiation. 

Last telemetry.  Scans. Even though the ship is dead I can see what it saw when it came down.  Shows a structure. Long walk from here. Could be someone lives here after all. May as well try.

“Guess this is it.”
