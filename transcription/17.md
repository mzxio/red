six ways till sunday. of course it came to this. it was never going to be any other way, because it wasn’t any other way. tautology, oxymoronic destiny. we are both killers. you killed her. i killed him. we both tried to warn each other, neither of us was listening. just walking, talking. fucking two (lives/lines) right next to each other. we were supposed to be together, but we were always separate. i didn’t trust. i still don’t. maybe i should have trusted you. maybe there was always another way. too late now. i held my hand where yours was supposed to be.
