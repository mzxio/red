there is no such thing as being in control.

you can’t control anything outside yourself. you can’t control very much inside yourself either. can you control your own decisions? your actions? your environment, influences maybe. you have choices. but no other person is ever really yours to control. love can’t be controlled. the forest fire may be called a controlled burn, but what is that really? controlling the uncontrollable. chaos inside a bounded zone. controls are all external. there is no way to control the heart of a thing.
