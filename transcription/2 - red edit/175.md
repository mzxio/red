Fires burning.

Smoke rising, an undisturbed column in the windless sky.

Never seems to get any closer no matter how much I walk. If not for shadows moving, tracks on the ground, there is no time. Only hills, sun. 

The crash is always over the next ridge. What will I find when I get there, if I get there? Will there be anything left? Maybe I should just rest here.
