The last jump. 

`Charging.`

Plot your course. Your ship will break after this. You know all you can know. Millennia of stellar observations, catalogs, indices. Could it ever be enough? Wherever you end up, there is where you’re going to stay. Choose well. Can you even choose?

No one else is coming. Just you and whatever you brought with you. Who should here but isn’t, lost along the way? Who more than anyone else do you wish was here now?

Doesn’t matter now. Can’t change the past. Can’t go back.

`Charging.`

Do the calculations. Reference, coordination, projection. 

`Charging.`

You’ve known for a while this was where you were headed. Waiting in anticipation. Death rushing up to meet you. All the hope and fear from prior epochs, all focused ahead. Nothing to do but wait and check your calculations.

`Charging.`

Not long now. the accumulators are almost full, straining to do their task this one last time.

`Ready.`

“Jump.”
