How quickly can things change? One way or another?

The lesson that kills is no lesson at all. That is how fast things can change. Pivot points where all our stories turn. Traveling from one reality to another. Almost impossible to explain later. In between it could be years, generations. 

We forget why things were the way they were, why we thought as we did. What seems important to parents seems trivial and overdone to their children. Grandchildren repeating the mistakes of their grandparents. 

“Some things you have to learn the hard way.” 

No amount of history or collective memory could save them all. The children taught themselves. They learned in their own way in their own time. Some learned what came before. Little by little they discover more, and stop repeating some mistakes. The learning takes time.
