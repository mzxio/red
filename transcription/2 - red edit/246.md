what is there to hope for? we created a myth centuries ago. it tells of so-and-so doing something worth remembering for so long. we keep the myth alive, breathing in our ears since before this place even existed. my ancestors came here and found this land on their own but even then the myth made it there first. if it hadn’t, they would have been its carriers. the myth like an almost immortal being, like the gods of old. stop praying to them, stop telling the myth, and soon both will be lost to time. as long as we live and take it with us, the myth endures. my ancestors and their ancestors, all the way back until there is no memory, to a time when only the myth still remembers any of who we were. my ancestors knew the myth and carried it on their longest trip, the one they took to come here. i don’t even know their names but i can tell the myth and think maybe they told it too. in this way the ancestors may be kept alive even when they are lost and forgotten.
