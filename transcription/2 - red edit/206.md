Signals from the deep.

Formless noise, then modulations. Pulses and tones. Regular. A long pause, a low baseline drone, then rough harmonies. Mathematically precise tones. Wet and bubbling like a stream, uneven in its precision. Then repeats. Again and again.

How many tones followed by how much silence? Communicating something. It means something to someone somewhere, nothing to me. Just tones. Just sounds. 

Maybe I’ve heard those sounds before? They make me feel a certain way. A deep fear. Something is wrong. They represent its wrongness. An alarm? That’s all. Nothing more.

What is happening? Should I prepare? Is it even meant for me? It could be an alarm somewhere else, far from its original purpose. Propagated and echoed until arriving here. 

It goes on and on for a while. The tones. The silence. Again. Eventually I don’t hear it any more. Did I miss something important?
