what’s left when all your friends are dead, or behind the wall, under lock and key? what’s left when there’s no fight left and no one to carry the day? the demoralized army surrendered in shame, they might say. decimated and cut off, they fled into the hills. some took off their colors and sank into the society that annihilated them. if you can’t see it or hear it, you won’t think it.the one who was once an enemy, now living next door. would you ever know the difference? would you ever feel threatened? or would you have won so utterly in your mind that your way was only ever the real way(?) anyone who’d ever be your enemy came from far away, savages, barbarians from another land. never your neighbor, (-never-) so defeated to live in utter isolation, assimilated and subsumed by your culture. washed away by your wild rampant need to be master over all you survey. and if you did see your neighbor, as they were, would you make them your enemy again? would they be an affront to your domination?
