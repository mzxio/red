### Tying knots. 

“Wonder what so-and-so is doing now.”

“Why would it be any other way?”  

Ghosts in the bathroom. Infinite regret. Same thing that keeps anything else from happening. Roll up. Bathrooms are clean.

Play it forward. Crumble. Not all at once. Slow change. Good becomes just ok. Ok becomes bad. Ruins by the highway. Someone from the old world knows they’ll share the same fate. Pull one piece out and the entire thing comes down.

Next services forever away. The tank won’t hold that much gas. You’ll have to walk the rest. What is gas anyway? A forgotten century’s obsession. Soon something else.

The bones of truck stops bleach in desert sun and, wind blows the ghosts out to sea. No palace here for any of us. No one but the ones we lost. The ones we left. The ones we’ll never see again.
