# 6

Parting kisses at the corner.

“We don’t have to think like that any more.”

Taking the capsule. For escape or surrender.

`2HR MAX PARKING`

Can’t walk here any more. Kicked out by the city. Chewed up, spat out, spat on. Kicked, punched, robbed. Paying taxes to institutional muggers.

Stop and breathe in the still morning.
