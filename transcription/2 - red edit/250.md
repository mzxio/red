Living in two places. 

No one remembers because no one knows. Dwelling in the past and the future, all in the present. Different bodies. Friends. Family. Whatever we made from was left of what was here before. 

The work of building is past. Now the long work of maintenance. Keep the lights on. Tend to the garden. In the end there will be no higher calling. Waiting, watching. The custodian.
