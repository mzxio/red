Atomic life, searching for self. 

Society couldn’t withstand a void. It invented new rituals, used old ones to start. Oral history was easy to devour. All the old eaten up so no one new will know anything different from the culture you build. Only a few people won’t be convinced. Some will remember the old ways.

“What happened?” 

Tell them whatever you want to tell them. If they keep asking, just outcast them from your society. Make sure their answers are forbidden and destroyed, that they cease to exist. Let your population self-select. Those who ask, who wonder, who live in fear, they will be pushed  to the edges. Your followers and believers will group together. Tell your tribe to be afraid of everyone else. Invent some secrets to let them in on. Hurt them secretly so you can help them publicly. Buy their loyalty. They will police the others. They will build defenses for you.

Keep them listening and believing and you win.

“They’re at the gate.”
