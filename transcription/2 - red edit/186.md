A way out.

What do you do when there’s only one way out? When that way is almost certain death? Here, soon, there won’t be a real me. No supplies. No air. Just a few hours left. Dead, alone on whatever rock this is.

The pod still has power. I can stay and die as myself or leave a corpse in the pod and go on as a clone of who I was. 

Not much time now. the choice will make itself soon.
