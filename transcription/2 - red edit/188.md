Jump.

A deep rumble to a whine. Ramping, spooling. Up and up. 

Collapsing. Pinched, squeezed, compressed. Pure weightlessness, absence of all gravity beyond even subtle perturbations of distant bodies. Pulled both forward and back. Great noiseless noise. Acceleration without motion.

Crossing the threshold.

Illusory direction. Luminance drawn out, radiating pure energy. A blast of light. Impossible speed past speed. Ploughing into infinity. Ragged disturbances in the flow reveal shaken afterimages of invisible bodies beyond. Riding rushing currents of ebbing swirling energy. 

Then it’s over. Welcome to the other side.

`Jumped.`
