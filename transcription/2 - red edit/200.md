whatever was here before, it’s gone now. nothing but rock and ruin, decimated by the wind and the rain and the swift seasons. tales of ancient greats, the ones who came here before. first? of course they thought so. who is really the first to get to a place? who is last? is there any way to tell? mostly it’s not important. i am not the first. i am not the last. they were here before me. someone will be along son after. for now it’s just me and the ghosts. a hand full of sand. what’s the significance of this place? some old meeting place. they say there was an entire city here but these columns are all that remain. an important meeting is said to have taken place here. where the fate of many were sealed, a meeting of peace. armistice. the end of a long war. neighbors struggling, killing, dying. they decided to stop. this is where they stopped it. what ceremony did they perform? did they lay down their weapons at the entrance and then walk inside? did they bow or kneel or sign? did they know what later there would just be another war? that this place would be destroyed for what it represented, that old order? the ghosts are full of grief and knowing. they were here at the very beginning. they will be here after the end. maybe they are the ones who will be last.
