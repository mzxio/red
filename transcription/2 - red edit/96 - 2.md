equipment failure. the slow degradation of time. all things physical that live eventually die. disconnection, failure. traveling through dangerous places speeds it up. radiation, collision, accidents. one failure begets another. eventually there can be no travel, or the certainty of death before reaching the next destination. carrying life, every step is taken for its preservation. the carrier takes the hits so its precious cargo is preserved. the journey has no other purpose but the preservation of that life. the carrier knows of its own inevitable death and carries on for the hope and certainty of finding a place to rest, to lay down its burdens. to let the life it shelters flourish and grow without the same fears, without the same trials. without the radiation and the pummeling rocks and the battles and the long grinding eternity between the stars. eventually the carrier comes to face the question: stop here, where here may be less than ideal, or try for there, knowing that it may never make that trip(?) knowing it may die and all life with it will die too. so it makes a choice.
