The place of ancient trials.

The hill overlooking an old town, rolling farmlands. Littered bones of the ones found guilty of whatever crimes, subject to whatever punishment. Here the justice was swift and grotesque. Victims of another sort. Bones, commingled shards of the accused.

“Who is without sin?”

Ancient legends tell of someone who died on a hill such as this, overlooking a town, whose death bought passage for everyone to a better place hereafter. No ancient death absolved me of my sin. Casting back, recalling fully, there is no reason I should stand here as the witness and not the accused. There is no reason for my bones to be intact while these forgotten souls crunch underfoot. These should be my bones. 

“We are all taken, no matter what.”
