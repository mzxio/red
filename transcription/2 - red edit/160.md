“Too far to turn back now.” 

Driving, driving. West. East. Encircled. The loop closes, the noose closes. Tightening, squeezed. Life choked out. Even the ancestors can’t save us.

They said it would usher in a new era, and they were right. They said we were at the apex of history, that we stood on the shoulders of all who came before. Scars breeding new growth, new life too. Left addicted. Hooked. Craving more. More nooses, strangling us without even knowing until it’s too late.
