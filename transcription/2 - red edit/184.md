This place was beautiful. 

Once, before the dome fell, there was a garden here. Must have been pleasant. Like a summer back home. Airy homes with windows thrown wide, birds singing. Trees, plants, water. Music.

All frozen now. Dead, desiccated. Silent.

Maybe there’s bones in here too. Most of the dome stayed up. Crushed houses underneath. Impossible to say how old. Old enough. Markings worn away. This place must have belonged to someone. Some or people or company or government. A far away private oasis. Maybe they left something I could use. Guess I’ll search the houses.

Not much air left.

“There’s worse places to die.”
