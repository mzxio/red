Music from the deep. 

Again and again the song plays. Even when the vision is gone, when all returns to what might be reality, the song plays on.

It takes a long time for the mother to fall from the sky. In her death she blazes for days. A ring of fire burning on high. At the place where worlds collide, timeless beings look on in silence. Perfection. 

“The whole world saw it. We all remember.”
