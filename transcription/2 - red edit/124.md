in the heart of the ancient plan. towns and cities rising from villages and camps. growing in concentric patterns. at the center of each a fire, whatever fire is at the heart of your house. from a hovel with a weak foraged supply of wood to a city square with the church of a sun-worshipping religion at the center. whatever fire, whatever gravity to hold people in its orbit. developing connections with the outside, a respiration of goods and supplies and people. livestock, stores. defenses. someone wants to extinguish the fire or take it for themselves. will you let them? no? thus begins the cycle of war. better defense, better attack. they still want the fire, even though so much time has passed and if we really look we can’t find all that much different between ‘them’ and ’us’. sometimes a period of stasis, equilibrium. pause. let the land breathe with the settlement. people go about their business. networks of settlements form. roads, trade. the composition of the network influences the shape of its components. some settlements swell, some shrink, some vanish.
