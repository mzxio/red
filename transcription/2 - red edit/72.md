No return.

There wasnâ€™t any way to pull back from the edge by the time we came to it. Already traveling too fast. 

Screaming rhetoric, chanting revolution. Melting ice, rising ocean, falling bomb. Nuclear fire. Escape, ignite, engulf. Creation, destruction, purest of absolutes. Fucking our way to sweet mutual release.

A long runway. Rattling and groaning, bumping, screaming. Air becomes thick like water, like ice. Thick enough to stand, to fly. Thick enough to ride. Cocks and cunts, buried deep, pointed at their hearts. Riding closer and closer. Bucking and breaking. Crying for the heavens.

Bottom drops out. Weightless. Cumming. Blast off. Tidal waves crashing, steel melting, hearts afire. The plane pulls to the sky, the city disappears. All is black and orange and blue and white. Love and bodies, madness, earth, machines and calculations.

They call it freedom. Escape. Orgasm. 

We make the new world.
