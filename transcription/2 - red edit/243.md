Old people hanging out at an old store. 

They’ve been there forever. The people, the store. Time seems to sink and slow. Darker, quieter, cooler. 

“Someone turn up the heat!”

The young folk will sweat and swelter any time they come in. The old folk will seem grumpy, uninterested. They’ve been here forever, after all. Forever for you, anyway. But not forever for them. They’ve been here for every day of it. They can reach out to all those times. If you cared enough to listen, your forever is an afternoon for them. That’s why they seem so uninterested in talking. They’ve heard most everything you could ever say. They’ve heard it before. What could you have that would ever interest them?

Do you remind them of their children? Perhaps people from long ago? Doesn’t seem so now, but back then they looked like you and your friends looked like their friends.

No use telling it. youth is spent on the young. One day maybe you’ll be sitting here too.
