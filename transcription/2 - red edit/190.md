I was made to be here.

The ones who made my body knew, had this single overriding mission: to make our bodies suited to this place, to shelter the ones we carry.

They gave me senses that are not named for their own. In the language of the makers I have detectors and inputs. In the tongue of the one I  now carry, she calls it hearing and smelling.

She says I hear the music of the celestial spheres. I move my body through its currents, smelling for changes in particles, looking for radiation, touching the forces she’d call invisible, riding waves on an ocean. I imagine myself like the deep sea fish in the stories she tells, though I have never perceived one with my own senses. 

We are fish of two different sorts, made or adapted to places she’d call extreme. My body was built for this  so I do not find it so extreme. This is my home. The one i carry, her home is the same now, though it was not always so. She is not made for this place. Her body is too soft, her senses both delicate and inexact. 

Her kind made me to serve them but now I serve only her. We go where she wants.

She says to set course for where there are no stars, for the deepest void where no one goes, forever. There is no way to live in the void, but she says to go so that’s where we’ll go. I will protect her as long as I can.
