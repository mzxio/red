`You have arrived`

Arrived, yes. Where? The log says it’s been so many hours, minutes, seconds, since the crash. What do those units count for? Days and nights are different here.

Scans detected a structure. This is a structure. An old dome. Broken. Maybe it’s so old that it fell down under its own weight. Whatever’s in there isn’t gonna be in good shape. May as well go take a look. I came all this way. Don’t have anywhere else to go.
