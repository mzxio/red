What do we take with us?

All the same. Then isn’t all that different from now. Pieces realign. The whole doesn’t change. Destiny may have already chosen. It may not matter what you chose. If you don’t have a choice, what do you choose? 

Follow whatever you’re going to follow. Follow the tears, scattered on the wind. Follow the path set before you, glittering in the darkness.

There is another way. Fly against destiny. Fly until there are no more choices. Fly and fly until the last of you is spent and all that once supported you is exhausted. Fly headfirst into the void and fear no darkness. Fly until the ages of your world are spent. Fly until all words lose meaning and the universe itself is nothing but a faint glow on the horizon. 

“Who would you be in any other time?”
