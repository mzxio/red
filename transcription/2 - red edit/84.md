Nowhere. Now here. 

Nothing but here, no matter what here is. No-thing. Absence. Nothing nowhere. Infinity of oblivion. Unbounded, undirected. Any direction is the same as all direction. No frame to say where here ends and there starts. Itâ€™s all here, nowhere.

Traveling into nothing means taking something, shattering the slow quiet dark. Even information taints a flawless void, carrying its memories and stories through nowhere to somewhere. Absolute void must exist apart, held by opposing forces. A carefully crafted realm, held in equilibrium. Nothing-ness, something-ness. 

There is so much nothing in every something. Clear every thing away. Practice nothing. Study the balance between thingness and nothingness. To name a thing to separate it, to bring it out of the void. Hold these unreconcilable values together as one.
