After years the pod activated again. 

Someone came through.

She said she knew me on the outside. On the other side.

I couldn’t know.

She said we were together. Another her, another me.

She said she wanted to come so I wouldn’t be alone. So we’d be together in both places.

She said she wanted to stay.
