they stayed inside when the rain came. nothing much serious needed doing. from under eaves, through windows, they watched. rain fell on the fields, on the hills. the river swelled with silt and foam, swirling debris washed away. it rained all day and all night and into the next day. smith’s forge and potter’s kiln steamed billowy clouds of steam, the houses smoked. everyone huddled together in the halls, drinking and eating, laughing and talking. the farmers were sour that they couldn’t get anything done. children played and shrieked and ran underfoot. it was an early spring and most welcome. the rain stopped on the second evening, heavy mist rising from the fields in the late afternoon light, purple and blue and orange. one farmer’s barn had washed away, some animals were lost. everyone got together in the gathering night, with sticks and lanterns, and went out looking for the creatures. all but one were found, washed into the river in the tumult. another farmer shared a barn with the first, gathered up all the remaining animals, and got them inside. midnight came and the rest of the village slept, waiting for the dawn when the fields would come alive once more.
