No patience, gluttonous.

Filling empty spaces with unfulfilling things, then chasing even more. Consuming, left with only the consequences. Stand away evaluate value and risk, cause and effect. Nothing to do but be patient, consume less.  Patience. Wait, think, then act. Reaction is what all objects do, introspection is something that thinking beings can undertake. 

“Stop fucking consuming. it doesn’t fill the holes. It just makes new ones that have to be filled later on.”
