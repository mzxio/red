There is no way for memories to provide sustenance.

Don’t feast on fruits that can never sustain. You cannot eat the memory of a fruit and receive nourishment, no matter how sweet that memory is. It can only distract, never feed. Never heal.

Reminiscences, recollections of people or places or times, they are the same. Nothing alive to be found there. At best it preserves a depiction of what’s been lost, giving breath to a shallow simulacra.

To remember the dead is to keep their ghosts alive. To remember the living fragments their spirit, separating who they were from who they are for themselves from who they are to you. Can any one fragment contain their true being? Whatever their true self is, you don’t have access to it if all you can do is remember them. The best you could accomplish is holding on to who they were when you knew them. Important pieces will be missing, always. 

“Reflections in broken glass.”

“We may be children of the infinite, but we are beings of the present.”
