# 91

Walking in circles without a map or memory.

Whatever it is, gone now. There was something, I know it. Thought, sense, idea. Snuffed out at the moment of waking, when it could have taken on a life of its own. Now, nothing. Shallow shapes given to the shapeless. Making plans for the future.

What I know today I forget tomorrow unless I write it down. 

Canâ€™t trust anyone from the future to ask. Could just keep no records. Go only from one moment to the next. Then nothing deliberate will ever happen. Keep forgetting and relearning, going round and round. Repeat all your past mistakes, re-solve problems that already had solutions. 

Forget it all. Learn nothing. Until the next time.
