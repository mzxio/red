Lining up for one last chance at life. 

Waiting ten, fifty, a hundred deep. Until someone said “no more gas” and no amount of cursing or threats would bring any more. Where next?

“You don’t have to go home but you can’t stay here.”

Sweltering in the desert, shivering in the city, no difference. Same desperation, same yearning, same fear.  Back of the line is first to die. If you let someone in front of you, will they turn back to help, to return the favor? Maybe. Doubt it. I wonder though... how many turn around?
