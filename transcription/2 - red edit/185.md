What is this place?

An elevator with only colors, no numbers. Deep in the ground. Deep enough to lose signals from above. 

Levels of storage boxes going on and on. I havenâ€™t looked in any of the boxes yet. mostly all the same size. No markings I can read. Only symbols meant for automated readers. 

Whoever built this place wanted it to last.
