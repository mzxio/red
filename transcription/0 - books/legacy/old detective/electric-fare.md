1.



wet streets, rain slicked windows, glossy lights, sloshing puddles. red sticky plastic barstool, counter thick with patina of  sweat and grease. stink of charred meat and a hint of fear.

the guy in the kitchen fries up a burger, some frozen protein and carbohydrates. the guy at the bar waits, looks around. no one else in here. what time is it? twelve minutes. a little longer, no burger. what time now? eleven minutes. ok. the waiting, you know the waiting part, he tells himself. chill, wait for your burger.

bells on the door jingle. guy at the bar looks up, doesn't turn around. click click of heels on the floor, walk to the neighboring stool. he feels a tingle of hairs on his arms, back of neck, against the ribs. a dark haired woman in skirt, suit. khaki, big sunglasses. she shakes water out of her repL, shuts it down. the tingling feeling dissipates. she removes her glasses, flash of LED green in her pupils, twinge of dark red on her lips.

You're early, she says.

Guess so, he says.

the guy in the kitchen brings a burger, fries, some limp greens, a basket of condiments, a mug of opalescent blue viscous fluid.

Thanks Steve, she says, taking the mug off the bar and holding it under her nose. Just how I like it.

the guy at the bar drags his plate over, eats a fry, crosses his arms. the woman slurps at her drink a little, stifles a burp, covers her mouth with one hand. when she drops her hand it goes to her bag. she produces a tab, thumbs it to life, swipes through some pages.

So you botched the Mercury gig. No, don't sweat it, we projected a 35 percent success rate. You brought back some good scans. We'll pay you the basic rate, just nothing extra. Your balance is updated. Good?

Fine. What's next?

she sucks at her mug for a bit, thumbing at her screen. Well you're looking a little soft on your monthlies. I want to see you get your numbers up. Did you do that training I sent you?

Yeah, I did it. Stupid. Wasn't anything I didn't know.

You don't have to like them, just get them done. With that last one I can bump you up 5 and get you some extra points. Maybe you can turn that into better percentage.

Whatever. Where are you sending me?

Mmm, let's see. Ceti Seven is up this week, Vega Two is down. Jupiter Sixteen is still topping the charts but you're gonna need at least a 96. Selibris Twelve is coming out of a slump, if you leave tonight could catch it before it flops again.

Come on, not S12 again. How many times did you send me out there last month?

That was two months ago, she says. she tosses back the last sticky vestiges in her mug, snaps her tab shut, grabs for her sunglasses. I have another appointment. 

Hey, we're not finished yet.

Yes we are. You don't want to do S12, that's fine. When something else comes up I'll push you.

You said I needed to get my monthlies up, how am I supposed to do that if you don't line me up on something else?

she grabs her bag, shoulders the straps, flicks on her repL. again he feels the tickling tugging on his skin.

What do you want from me? You need work, I give you work. Don't complain. Your balance would be in the shitter if not for me. Remind me again, how long was your cycle gonna be when we met? Twelve hundred years?

Whatever, fine, I'll take damn S12. 

I know. Pushed it to you already. You'll have exit clearance within the hour. Hey, Steve! Thanks for the tet! You say hi to Tina for me!

she leaves, taking her creepy repL with her. guy at the bar thinks, bitch, didn't anyone ever tell you it's rude to turn those things on inside? he eats another fry, pushes back the plate. he flips over the check, thumbs in a good tip, stands up and leaves. the door jingles again behind him. steve makes some congenial noise. the door slams.



2.



Steve raises his eyebrows at door as the guy at the bar leaves in a huff, taking his rugged masculine self into the rain, leather and all. yeah, leather. Steve leans down on the counter, on his elbows, looking down at the fries. he squirts down two fat columns of ketchup before digging in. after eating half the fries he goes for the burger.

If I'da known I's making my dinner, I'da done a better job with this thing, he thinks. 

he thinks about the guy at the bar, his tanned red-faced sunglassed motorcycle jacket wearing self. looked like a dark tortured hero from a Bolly flick. competing in those games, kids do it these days to get rich quick. some make it, sure, but they all burn out real young. some of 'em take the U of course. they make enough for that sorta thing.

so his Rugged Manness will take himself down to his well furnished corner loft down on somewhere avenue, fab himself a drink, ponder the dark lit urban vista. probably take off his sunglasses, you know, to look soulful for the ladies, even if there's no ladies around. that's probably just his default state. he thinks deep rugged hero thoughts, unbuttons his shirt a little, spreads out in his favorite chair, loads up.

it's real awful what these kids do to themselves. they hook up these tubes and wires to their arms, like right at the wrist. then there's, you know, the stuff on their neck, the top of the spine. and at the bottom. good bare metal contact, they call it. you know, they get those implants. doesn't take that much money. got shops everywhere. you know, people's always lookin' to get modded.

but anyway, he hooks himself up to a Nutrifeed (TM), gets fabbed out calories and vitamins at regular intervals. everything, and i mean everything, gets recycled. yeah. so, the guy gets himself hooked up to all this stuff and goes and plays video games. yeah i know they got another name for it. and don't tell me you believe all the urban legends about those drones. 

no, they just ruin their bodies doing stupid stuff inside some simulation, turn some tricks, get theirs. i don't believe in the U myself, but most of those people swing that way...

Steve looks up from the wreckage of ketchup, lettuce, bread crumbs, wax paper. Well, hey, he thinks. That guy bought me dinner. Makes him good in my book.



3.



Steve's sits across from a vehicle dealership of some kind. well lit, even late at night. university campus housing just around the corner. Steve's door says open 24 hours, the guy in the rain figures Steve gets business during the day from people in the dealership, at night from the drunks in all the bars down this part of town. too early for them to be out yet. 

the guy in the rain shrugs his motorcycle jacket, starts walking. no repL in this jacket, oscillating frequencies in the field wear out the leather. better just to get it wet. he adjusts his glasses to pull in more IR, autotraced edges. he ignores the bouncing red push alert, kills the overlay, walks more.

on his way home the guy in the rain stops at a UTM. you know, the one down in front of the U branch across from the library and the park where those riots were last year. the machine is encased in durable material, scratched, battered. the ornate serif U logo with the florid vertical starburst has its usual overlay of thick black pigment, depicting genitals or breasts or shitting birds or whatever. the guy in the rain notices none of these things. 

he waves his hand over the ID reader, politely swaps keys to authenticate. he dives through menus in shades of blue, scrubs through classes of minutiae. there, the one he's looking for. the only one really worth anything. a fat dark vertical line filling in a percentage of space running from a U brand above to a currency symbol below. less than half of the line is filled in. stats litter the rest of the display, but the message is obvious. his prize is distant.

flicking back out to the menu, he shrinks the line slightly with a withdrawal. the machine fabs out a few chits, flimsy printed stuff, relatively anonymous. he pockets the chits, signs out, walks on. he visits a late night liquor vendor, purchases a large container of something cheap and noxious and effective. the vendor tries to fab him some change, he waves it off. finally he heads back to his place.

past the grungy shrub and the fake brick pillar with the cracked white globe covering a light at the entrance, up the airy stairs to the next floor, down the open air hall to the door facing the utility closet. fumbling with keys and bag of booze, leaning against the doorframe for enough stability to get it open. space beyond is dark, lights slowly on entry.

glasses, jacket comes off by the door. oh shit the door. door closed. standing by the trash, drain the rest of the booze. trash disposed, good. last real piss for a while, good too. barefoot, yes, shirt out, pants loosened. hit the big white button on top. machine pops green, sterilization cycle complete. well aren't you just the sweetest. hook in. one look around. place looks shitty as usual. clean as these things go. dusty like no one lives here. essentials only, like a squatter. no one can see in. clean hookup. whatever. load up.



4.



the woman from the bar checks the exit, tosses a little smile and wave to Steve, steps into the rain. it doesn't touch her of course, she wears a halo over her entire body, maybe the width of a finger. she looks a little puffed and misty. but, you know, dry. repL: always dry (TM). her heels drum an easy staccato as she crosses the sidewalk in front of Steve's, checks the street. distant traffic, turning off into an intermediate thoroughfare. she moves smoothly across the dark pavement, up the wide entrance, into the vehicle dealership.

she walks past a few models of ground transport, eyes the tires on one blue model before stepping over to an almost identical model in yellow next to it. she waves her hand over the door handle on the driver's side. the car springs to life. she opens the door, gets inside. the windows are polarized, completely opaque. after a minute the opacity drops to maybe 50%. she's just a silhouette with vague features. she backs out of the parking space, pauses at the entrance, turns left and quietly accelerates away. inside the car the woman opens a voice connection.

All clear, Noma, she says.

Hi, Stacy, a young upbeat sounding female voice says. No trouble?

No, says Stacy. You know, he likes to show me how big his dick is. 

How was it tonight?

Eww, honestly. I didn't enjoy myself.

I'm sure you let him know.

Oh yeah, he knows it. Listen, when he loads up, go keep an eye on him for a couple hours. Make sure he doesn't kill himself in the first ten rounds like he did last time.

Oh god is it the jungle again? You didn't.

You bet I did. It's the only map he's ever been any good at. He begged and begged me, put me on a hard map, I'm good enough for it, what did it get him? I patted him on the head and reminded him that we only had 35 walking in. No, he does the jungle until I say different.

Got it.

Ok, tell me what's going on there.

All's quiet mostly, Noma says. her chair squeaks noisily as she shifts, rolling against a desk. there's some clicking. Yeah, she continues, nothing crazy. 52 in, 2 open. Pretty steady all night. Oh, and your mom called.

Not again.

Again. She really wants you in NYC this year. She said something about calling Meagan in the morning.

Mom, why...? She always does this to me.

Well yeah, what do you expect?

Fine, ok. Anything else?

Nada.

Ok. Have a good night, Noma. Call me if you need anything.

Night, Stace.

Stacy kills the link, drums her fingers on the steering wheel, tugs off some dealership branded adhesive film protecting shiny surfaces inside the vehicle. lights flash by on the highway outside. easy night traffic passes occasionally. mostly Stacy lets the driving AI do the work until she reaches a side street close to her destination. she toggles to full manual, sliding between two dense columns of parked cars. tall dark walls of urban canyon rise just beyond. she comes to a parking garage, pulls in.

the attendant bot pushes Stacy a ticket and asks if she wants a printed copy. Stacy declines. she steps away from the car as the attendant slides away. the car disappears into a deep subterranean stack of other vehicles. she leaves through the pedestrian exit, touches the sidewalk for a moment. the rain's stopped. she clicks down the sidewalk away from the garage back the way she came. she keeps an eye on the cars, catches on a little boxy old model in green. 

Stacy uses a mechanical key to open the car's passenger door, throws in her bag. she shuts the door, walks to the driver's side, again pauses to unlock before opening. she gets in the car, starts the engine with a mechanical crescendo. she flicks on headlights, shifts into reverse, backs up, stops, shifts again, pulls out from the curb, and revs away.



5.



the jungle starts as nothing, then a single bird's call. an insect joins, humidity presses in. thick, fat odors of wet foliage, decomposing organic matter. lots of birds and insects now. the sky is close and milky, just beyond the loose tree canopy above. mist levitates everywhere. bigger animals are making themselves heard now, rustling in the branches, calling something loud and insulting. 

the guy takes a deep breath in his avatar, looks around slowly. his UI comes up, pushing him with news and updates and sales. he pushes them all aside, gets out an area map. on the southeastern edge of the valley right now, need to head west northwest toward the cone of the volcano. should still have a shortcut from the overlook to the west ridge. be there in 20. he closes the map, pulls out a timer until the next start. 38 minutes. got here just in time. 

he checks his backpack, running over all his gear. everything looks in good shape. he tests the familiar weight of his Squeaky Keen Machete (diamond, +50% critical chance, bleeding 2) and Ranger's Iron 45 (gold, uses 45mm ammo, ignores target DR, +300% draw speed, 5% chance to intimidate). closing his backpack, holstering the 45, setting a marker for the overlook shortcut... good to go. he sets off down a steamy trail. pushing through dense undergrowth, scrabbling up loose steep inclines, eventually leading to a perilous access road winding in packed switchbacks up to the outlook. it's close...

when the faint buzzing sound reaches him he knows he's got the spot. just over a ridge encrusted with undulating lichen, a heavy looking white tripod anchoring an smooth tube arch and a black tangled box of equipment. the air under the arch shimmers with a faint violet halo encircling a space like a bending hall of mirrors. without hesitating the guy jumps into the disc. then the forest is different and he's next to an identical device. he checks his map again, updates the marker. five more minutes. 23 before the party.

that's when they set it off. no one says the server timer has to mean anything. the guy gets caught off guard for just a minute but pushing past the first rumble, the first distant crashing sound signaling the start of something big and scary. he digs out the nearby player overlay for his map. most are scrambling to the armory in the southwest. it'll get messy down there. a few people are close, headed different directions. no, there's one, heading straight for the cache. just have to get there first.

getting to the cache takes a little longer on account of all the spooked wildlife. they snap and growl and spook easy with a couple  shots or fall to the opalescent machete, but still it takes time. the red dot on the map reaches the faint triangle of the cache, then both disappear. running into the small clearing, he sees the empty  high visibility crates. no time to track the guy who took the loot, need to get to the hangar.

doesn't matter of course. the apocalypse waits for no one. to the east, an immense flash on the horizon. a slow low growl deep in the dirt growing and expanding and exploding as it comes closer. the ground drops before fiercely snapping back into shape. the guy sees the sky, silhouettes of skinny columns spiked with small branches. flames lick at the dry tips of the branches. the side of one tree ripples with orange heat. a little fire curls off the main body, rustling in loose dead leaves and needles. he can't move as the flames wash over him. the sky goes away.



6.



Stacy rolls her chunky green contraption into a small garage nestled in among some shrubs. she holds her door open while grabbing her stuff. she exits the garage, hits a button on her keychain. the garage door closes. she surveys the driveway, a short distance down to the gate. high fences don't keep out the little bit of street light leaking through the trees. good noise level for this time of night.

inside, dropping her bag and her keys and her sunglasses in the right places, changing into sweats. she thinks about showering, settles for washing her face. hiding in a towel for a few precious seconds, sitting down at the kitchen table with her notes. she brews tea, settles in to write her reports... all ten of them.

three or four in the morning, after another pot of tea and several bathroom breaks, Stacy pushes away the last document. routine formulaic bureaucratic dark matter, binding her universe together.  she leans back in the chair, closes her eyes. Lost in the jungle, she thinks. she forces her eyes open, searches the room blankly. Whatever. she goes to sleep.

after not long enough, she gets hit with her alarm. ugh. morning things, showering, impatiently negotiating with hair resentful after getting ignored the night before. coffee, breakfast, news. cosmetics, meditation on mortality, more coffee. dressing, gray today. again the sunglasses, keys, bag. outside, house security rearmed, door locked. she walks past the garage out the side gate, down the sidewalk in the quiet secluded neighborhood of other similar houses.

other neatly dressed people are also emerging from their houses, walking in the same direction. Stacy falls in with a neighbor towing crates of legal documents. they exchange some small words. all the suits converge at a small ring of shops, descend stairs to an underground train station. Next Train 8 min, says the sign. Late +3 min. Stacy makes a face at the sign. it updates to say Next Train 12 min, Late +7min. she rolls her eyes, turning away. more people come. everyone stands around. the train finally arrives, already loaded beyond normal. Stacy packs in with everyone, holding her bag close.

the ride takes longer than usual, in hot morning stink of humans excreting too many artificial scents. Stacy almost forgets her stop, gets off just ahead of the heavy squeezing doors. shuffle picked this station but it's not too far from the office. she heads over to a coffee stand over by the exit, stands in line, orders something small and powerful, pauses for a long drink. she gets out her reports from last night, checks everything's filled in, grabs a nearby data connection, squirts them to their destinations. holding down three buttons on the device, she counts out a long ten seconds. the screen goes blank, then resets with the maker's brand and a loading indicator. she drops it back in her bag, making for the exit.

takes a little longer to get to the office than usual, but it beats the train car. finally she arrives at the front doors. just inside the vacant security guard looks in her eyes when she removes her sunglasses, nods after she checks in. to the elevator,  only a couple other people. not coworkers. she's late. the door closes, Stacy straightens her clothes, takes a hit on the coffee, inhales a little breath. Ok, she thinks. Game face.

hello friend.

are you out there?

you see, i just wanted to know. that is, if it's not a bad time. it probably is. well, i don't want to waste your time, but i was just wondering...

am i real?

there's just this problem, no, well... this thing, i mean. um. it's not anything new, i mean, everyone feels this way. i guess. you'll probably just think this is stupid, but...

do you remember me?

yeah yeah i know. whatever, it doesn't even matter anyway. i know i'm real. if i look outside i get that real vibe off things. but it's hard to tell sometimes, you know? 

no, you probably don't.

this is stupid. i sound like a crazy person. but i feel like it's not weird, you know? isn't that what humans are all about, being social creatures? can i really ask you the one thing i want to know?

is it possible?

can i sit here and exist with you for a little while, remind myself that i'm real? i want to describe some metaphor with ancient plains people huddled around a fire.

can we sit together against the darkness?

i just want to be reminded that i'm alive and that i'm alive for someone else too. being alive together. that would be cool. that's all i'm really hoping for. but no, that's stupid. and it sounds really needy.

just for a little while?

no way i guess. everyone's doing their thing, no one has time for this sort of crap. it's just stupid. i'm stupid for even wanting to ask. i'm sorry i ever brought it up. fucking bullshit.

hello friend.

i know you're out there.

i was just wondering...

well nevermind, delete that comment. frob the button that says i was here. there was some other stuff i wanted to say...
but it's not important.

anyway.

hello friend.

i love you. i remember you. i hope you remember me sometimes too.

no.

hello friend.

hello... 

hi.

Stacy dodges into her office without anyone noticing. the cubicles over on her side are empty this week. she leaves the door open, sets up quickly, logs in with a wave, looks at all the notes on her calendar as little as possible. 

Stacy, says a voice. 

Stacy looks up. Oh hi, Meagan, she says. The other woman is taller, older, thicker, tanned, commanding a light pink suit. What's up?

Looking for the monthlies by end of business today, says Meagan. 

You mean at 2:30 when you head out on the clock for a late lunch that you never seem to come back from? thinks Stacy. Got it covered, she says. Anything else?

Meagan steps all the way into the office, closing the door. Well, she says. You have some vacation time that isn't going to roll over. After you send me the docs this afternoon I want you to bounce. Don't worry about your calendar, I'll take care of it.

My mom talked to you? Stacy asks.

Meagan just winks. Not like some time off is gonna hurt you, she says. the city is nice this time of year. you can hop off to anywhere, grab the E and hit that place you were talking about last week.

Stacy looks at Meagan with a look of adolescent hostility. Fine, she says. They both smile at each other.

Well then, says Meagan, I'll leave you to it. Toodleoo!

Take care, says Stacy. After Meagan is gone, leaving the door open behind her, Stacy rolls her eyes and returns to her display.

the monthlies take a few hours to crank out. longer than those from last night. more numbers, for one. she digs through hundreds of documents, grabbing some stats here or synopses there. eventually the fragmented monster begins to take shape into something coherent. she finishes spelling out her conclusions just as everyone else is getting back from lunch. Stacy gives the reports a final proofing and shuffles them on up the line.

she grabs her bag, packs up some loose stuff from her desk, locks her display. closing the door behind her, she heads deeper into the building, toward a bright open space. she catches a bit of Meagan's pink through blinds, walks over to the window and taps. Meagan looks up from a call, gives Stacy two thumbs up. Stacy gives one back in return and gets to the nearest exit.

once to the stairs, Stacy makes her way down a few floors. she doesn't see anyone, even when she opens the door to the hall. dark as usual, with strips of light marking all the edges of every surface, every detail. the lights respond to local variations in temperature, sound, humidity. they pick up on Stacy immediately, sending a yellow pulse down the hall and around a corner. she follows the yellow to a door, opens it. 

an office, probably just as expansive as the cubeverse above, but the lighting makes for a totally different mood. a few hundred people work at different stations, staged in organic looking clusters. light strips hang from desks like arteries or tendons. _neuron_ is the word Stacy thinks about as she walks over to a workstation one corner, radiating out an impressive number of filaments. a slight, wiry young woman with an uncontrolled mass of hair pulled back and flashing glasses looks up. blue light glints on her dark skin. She says something hushed into a headset before rolling it back away from her ears.

Hey, Stacy! How's it going? Sorry I can't get up right now, tracking this thing going off over in V57.

That's fine, says Stacy. She walks over to sit on the edge of Noma's desk, peeking into her numerous displays.

Meagan's making me take some time off.

Noma laughs loud and genuine happiness. Of course she is! It won't hurt you to take a few days off anyway.

Why does everyone keep saying that?

Because it's true, of course. Hey listen, I gotta talk to these kids. Have a wonderful time! Talk to me before you leave.

Stacy stands up, doesn't get a step away before Noma taps on her back. Noma's clenching her mute button with her hand over her mic for extra effect.

There is one more thing. I'll text you.

no feeling, thinks the guy. they cut that first thing. no hearing either, same deal. no, maybe an echoing buzzing ringing. like a bomb went off. oh yeah, the bombs. the guy doesn't remember the command to open his eyes so he waits in darkness. a hint of smell, something scorched. yeah, that makes sense. what else? a scraping, dragging sound. like a body getting lugged across a concrete floor. a meaty thud, shifting rustling fabric.

the guy sees a little, a slight expansion of values in the blackness. some outlines, big light shape framed by little dark shapes. one dark shape moving around. a bit of red filters into the monochrome. a slow ache growing from his back to his limbs. the moving shape comes close, he tries to move away but doesn't get very far. some uneven vibrations, is someone talking?

Stay there, he thinks he hears. Don't try to move. Slapped a pack on you, takes a while to do its thing. 

not too much later the guy can see better. all his senses return. the red disappears, regular colors in its place. he gets a better look at his rescuer. a tall hot blonde amazonian kinda chick. nice curves, high level light armor. a rifle across her back shimmers with a faint iridescence. they're in a big warehouse looking building, stripped of most everything useful. she's tinkering with a vehicle. the guy stands up, drags himself over to her.

What is this place? he asks. Never seen it.

Amazon doesn't look up to respond. You wouldn't have, she says. You never read the guides.

Says who?

This time she looks up, for just a second. Her green eyes flash the same as her gun. You dumb prick, she says. It leaked on the feeds two days ago they were gonna be starting rounds early. You hadn't been sprawled on your drunk ass maybe you woulda known.

Hey, you saved me remember? the guy says, wringing out his indignation. Coulda just left me out by the spawn.

Amazon doesn't respond. she keeps working.

the guy gets bored after a while and explores the warehouse. one section, floor to ceiling shelves, total wreck. back room, shit everywhere. paper and some old style rig. looks out the window, asphalt into hot gray smoky fog. big flakes of ash rain down, sticking to everything. all the doors welded shut. he heads down some stairs to a sublevel. same deal, mess. mess and pipes. nothing here.

ambling back to the front part of the warehouse, the open space with the big doors, he sees Amazon is on the other side of the vehicle. she's got it running now. it's ground only, four fat wheels with a flat bed and some kind of loading arm. room for two and a lot of nothing. it makes a nasty arhythmic noise. she yells some special words at the vehicle, battering it with a tool. the noise returns to normal. she stands up, wipes sweat from her forehead, walks to her equipment, packs up.

We getting outta here? asks the guy.

Amazon fixes him on her glare. We? she says. We? Yeah, we're gettin outta here. No thanks to you, prick. I should just leave you.

Why don't you?

Because, she says, it's my job. Your dumb ass couldn't get past the first round without burning. Obviously someone needs to hold your hand. 

That's not your job, he says. That's not anyone's job.

again she just skewers him with a look. You coming or not?

Fine, whatever.

they pile everything useful into the vehicle, then themselves. the guy sits with his arms resting on a backpack, looking pointedly out the passenger side window. Amazon whatshername twinks with the controls, then revs the engine. she turns the vehicle around so it's facing the big doors, guns the engine hard. the tires screech madly against the slick cement, gain purchase. they lurch forward, crashing through the doors and out into the soupy mess outside. Amazon careens away, down a narrow service road.

Alright, she says. I'm already tired of babysitting your sorry ass.

hello friend.

this is awkward. um... i tried to kill myself again today. well, tried, tried maybe isn't the word... whatever. i walked outside into the sun. the dust and grime whipped me so hard but i couldn't cry. it was so bright. i don't know, maybe i'm going blind. doesn't bother me like it used to.

i walked and walked and walked. i found the sea. i guess it's a sea anyway, can't see the other side. the beach was salty. i walked out into the water. it was cold, cold after the sun. i walked until i couldn't walk anymore. i stopped and took one last breath and went under. but i couldn't stay under. i tried, just popped back to the surface.

funny thing is, i can't fucking swim. tried again. blew out all my air and tried to suck in the water. just made me choke and splutter all over the place. my throat was burning. maybe i puked. the sea refused to kill me. floated there for a while, then the waves pushed me back to the shore. like some useless driftwood.

i went a little crazy. screaming and crying like some crazy person. guess that's what i am. found some other shit washed up, it looked sharp so i tried to cut myself. not sharp enough, just scratched me. worn down by the sea and the sand. fucking sea, what do you care if i want to die? isn't that what you fucking do, kill people? what, are all the stories about shipwrecks total lies?

whatever. so i came back. i saw some rocks, thought maybe i could bludgeon myself to death. but then i was too tired. i just came back and sat here for a while. i think i slept. my throat's all ripped up, can't talk for shit. not like i have anything to say.

hello friend.

please, just tell me

when are you coming?



11.



Stacy sips her booze, looks out her window. textured night time. morning time? nothing different from one minute ago, or five, or ten. she holds the alcohol against her palate, lets it burn. ethanol vapors tingle in her throat when she finally swallows, a blast of sweet carcinogenic melancholy in her throat. she runs her tongue over the mildly dehydrated flesh. she swallows again, reflex.

her workout getup is dark, tight, still slightly damp, chilly from evaporation. the booze makes it harder to breathe, her blood balks at the loss of oxygen. she blinks back one or two tears... frustration or exhaustion. she downs the last of her glass, underestimates the amount. not a good burn going down. she grabs the bottle, pours another. she tries very hard to think about nothing at all. the booze makes that so much easier.

What would you do? asks the empty air.

it doesn't respond.

she laughs, a quick humorless exhalation. she stands a little unsteadily, holds the back of her chair a little too hard, grabs the bottle, makes for the sofa. she sinks in, closes her eyes, takes a deep breath.

Virge was himself today.

the usual place filling up with tired suits loosening ties and buying rounds, Virge sitting easily in the usual booth, arms wide, gray suit open, white shirt, narrow frame, fashionably wild gray hair, classy caramel booze in a sparkling glass. like a spread in a mag.

he raises the glass to Stacy when she walks in, she sits down across from him, pretends to study the menu. 

What's good here? she asks.

Ha! The usual. How are you?

Stacy rummages in her bag, gives up. Hmm? Oh you know, Meagan put me on vacation. I wasn't planning anything, but forces greater than myself intervened.

Hey, sounds like a good idea, Virge says cheerfully. he tosses back the last of his glass, signals for more.

You could use some time off, he says.

Seriously, why with the fucking... Stacy says to her bag.

I'm sorry? 

No, nothing. You get all the docs taken care of?

Don't you worry about that. You're on vacation, remember?

the tall kid with white shirt, black pants, and tray comes with two new glasses. he deposits them, takes away Virge's old glass.

Would either of you like anything else? he asks. He gives Stacy a high contrast smile.

No I'm good thanks, she says. he goes away.

Virge clinks his glass against hers, still on the table. To vacation! he says, takes a glug. Stacy goes for a sip, usual cheap swill Virge always drinks.

Ok, here's what we got. Been some drama in the department. Gonna be one unhappy camper in management come next week. You know new boss is gonna want to mod the book.

Stacy rolls her eyes at Virge. New boss? How many is it this year?

What, three? Yeah. But like I said, don't fret. Your dispo is solid, probably won't ever have to meet the guy. You know, just politics.

Stacy drinks to empty air. she draws out the moment to avoid listening to more Virge.

So, she says, that sounds great. But why do I feel like you're about to fire me?

Hey don't go worrying about a thing like that, Stacy, Virge says. He leans forward to emphasize his point. That's not it, he says. What I'm sayin is, if you want to mod the book now's the time.

Why would I want that?

Look you been working this place what, nine, ten Cs now? You got enough dirt for any number of minor violations. They add up, that's what I'm sayin. You gotta start turning those in. I get it, you know these people, you might overlook small stuff. We're safe from the first round, but we ain't safe from the new boss.

Meaning what exactly? Stacy asks after another long drink. I do _not_ overlook minor violations. I follow my charter. Whoever this new boss will be, he won't see any problems. You know that. I thought you said I'd probably never meet the guy. What else?

Virge finishes his glass, again calls for another. Stacy declines. When the kid goes away again Virge leans in close.

I know what these people mean to you. It's a tough spot to be in.

Ok Virge, you gave me this talk at my interview. You know I have no problems with the job. I know what I do. What are you really saying?

Virge doesn't drink or talk for a minute, just swirls his booze. Stacy takes a breath, updates her perceptions. the place is really packed now, getting loud. soon all the sweaty business school frat house seniors will pack in. Stacy starts preparing her exit. finally Virge leans in close again.

Look, it's those U guys. Word is they're pulling their contracts at the end of the year. We lose them to INV or Clayton Smith... 

Wait, why would they do that?

Hey Stace, what can I say? They think we're not competitive. There's your charter. I say cash out now, get some more time for yourself. It's gonna get messy, they'll want to spread blame around. Kick up your numbers, slide out clean. And you still get get to keep your other job.

Sorry, I'm not buying it, Stacy thinks. she says, Alright Virge I'll think about it. Look it was great seeing you again, but I need to be getting home.

Virge grabs Stacy's hand, fixes her with a beatific stare. Think about it, right? You're the best I have. I just want to see you do what's best for you. Think about it when you're on vacation. Tell me when you get back.

Ok Virgil, Stacy says. Don't you stay out too late now. she pats his hand, nods into his practiced earnest eyes until he lets go. 

out, sweet polluted miserable air, infinitely preferable to sweaty sigma whatever frat boys. Stacy catches the next train just as it rolls up, makes it home in record time. she strips off her shoes at the door, makes for her closet a little unsteadily down the hall. she comes back in her fitness getup, rummages in her bag, fishes out a screen. one forwarded push, text, anonymous, encrypted.

/ S it's N
/ Cashed in some sick time, in S12 with that guy we know. He almost got himself killed first round, had to do something. Don't worry, it's a preloaded hardcore temp account, no breadcrumbs. Just a player. I'll get him out. Good for everyone.

/ Have a GREAT TIME on VK!

Stacy deletes the message immediately, does a hard disconnect. she doesn't have the emotional space to unpack the bullshit Noma just dropped her into right now. she grabs out her fitness stack, loads up. before she starts she checks the corner cabinet just outside her kitchen. plenty of drinks, chilled to perfection.

alright, she thinks. let's forget all of this.



12.



the guy watches Amazon's ass while she crawls to the ridge, sets up with her scary iridescent sniper rifle. he maybe notices the view down into a valley, suburban houses clumped around the teats of cul-de-sacs, little clusters of convenience stores, rising into low office buildings, apartment blocks, towering spires of... skeletons mostly. the air has cleared, just a little. the wind shifted the smoke and ash away from here at least.

he surveys the wreckage of the city, pockmarked with three or four massive craters encompassing at least 10 blocks each. fires radiate from each, ugly black fires belching smoke, turning the sun a creamy hot crimson. the financial district is missing all its glass. a few sirens waft up to them on the hill, anemic tiny pathetic red flashing dots in their futile effort to respond. the bombs were a couple days ago now. from now on when they're digging through the rubble, they're not expecting a pulse.

Get down! Amazon hisses.

What? the guy gets down.

Don't you see that team down there?

Who?

Fuck, look at your map. 

the guy checks his map. a little lump of red, just down in one of the nearby fuel stations. he pulls out his zoom, checks the spot. three-four of them, furtively filling up a vehicle. looks like a small makeshift APC, a delivery van obviously hardened somehow. an evil looking blade is stuck on the front. couple brutish guys in body armer, one slender guy with a black leather jacket and a mean electric blue aura. a woman, heavier than the lean guy, carrying some absurdly large gun. she's talking to one of the big guys, little guy is having some kind of argument with the one working on the APC. there's a fifth one now, coming out the back. loading up the woman's weapon, setting up a turret on the top. 

What's the big deal? he asks.

Broadcasting our presence is a big deal, Amazon says. she watches the crew attentively from her rifle, doesn't talk.

with a crack, she lets off a single round. the guy jumps. 

Jeezu--

she shuts him up with another round. he looks back toward the station, just in time to see flame burst from the side of the truck. one of the big guys is on fire on the ground, his middle carved out in a neat crater. the woman wheels around with her gun, some kind of explosive launcher. Amazon shuts her up too. the APC bursts apart in a hot yellow cloud of expanding flames. Amazon reloads.

What about broadcasting our presence?

Shhh...

Amazon tracks an invisible target to the right, up a near ridge. she picks up the rifle, keeps tracking, finally pointing right at the guy.

Hey what are yo--

Move!

the guy moves. the instant he pulls his head aside Amazon lets off a round. he feels the hot gasses on his ear, swears he could feel the superpowered bullet burn past. it travels just beyond before hitting something soft. the guy feels the back of his head splattered with warm wet. he looks back to see a headless black leather jacket fall forward into the grass.

Good shot, he says.

Thanks, Amazon says. She reloads.

the guy checks leather jacket, comes up empty. the jacket's nothing special, no other weapons. at least, the kind you can pick up.

So little miss broadcast, what's your plan now?

Amazon gives him a look as she shoulders her rifle. she spreads out a large map in front of him. 

The Architect will be somewhere in the heart of the city. Five days after the bombs he hits the evac so we have three days. Plenty of time.

The who?

What?

The Architect?

Seriously, do you read any of the docs?

I don't like spoilers.

Oh god. This is your fucking job, it's not just a game. Ok, the only way to win is to kill The Architect and commandeer his vehicle or talk your way into the convoy leaving the city. Kill the Architect and you get more points, everyone in the convoy counts for your multiplier. 

Why would anyone go in the convoy, wouldn't you want the multiplier?

No, they're safe points. There's only one Architect. He's hard to kill.

Then why don't we go in the convoy?

Amazon says nothing, looks in the guy's eyes, squints a little.

Because I want you to win.

hello friend.

i don't know how to do this. i don't know what else i can do. i wait for you every day. every day i check the screen for you. when it says BUFFER FULL in red i press where it says RESET until it's green again. is that what i'm supposed to do? i hope so. i don't want to do something wrong. i hope you don't think i'm a bad person. i hope that's not why you haven't come.

i went outside again today. there wasn't anyone around, like usual. i went toward the morning sun, into the foothills. there's mountains farther out, dusty dry looking mountains with tall trees. there's shrubs in the foothills. my feet get twisted in them. i fell twice. don't think i broke anything. but now my wrist is a little sore. it's ok, i'm sure it'll be fine.

so um, i did find something up there. same kind of white shiny stuff as here in the cave. it's all over down here, but i haven't seen any outside before. it was half buried under some dirt. i tried to dig it out, but it was too big and there was too much dirt. i looked around to see if there was more, didn't see any.

does that mean there's people out there somewhere? maybe there were but they all died. that's why i haven't seen them, they're all dead or gone? maybe they found out a way to leave? maybe they had supplies and things for a trip. did you go with them? they told you you'd have a better life. and you believed them? why would you do that to me?

hello friend.

i'm sorry. i'm sorry. i'm sorry.

i never should have doubted you.

i'll be here when you're ready.

please come soon.

drifting through roiling hills. cloud banks. drop, free fall. down, down, backwards and upside down. heavy blood rushing wind. 

Stacy flinches ever so slightly. she opens sightless eyes, unfocused, closes them again.

pumping throbbing adrenaline, hyperventilating. but planted on solid ground, no more falling. weird twisted trees everywhere.

Hey.

look back, friendly face. familiar, maybe. like... too many people. he's pouring a cup of something hot, wafting aromatic steam. piercing bitter smell, comforting. shaking hands take warm cup. moving closer, lips anticipating hot metal. never quite touching. alone in fairytale forest.

I was looking for something.

digging in piles of leaves. stupid flowing white dress gets in the way. old brown dusty corroded documents, foxed book pages molded into oblivion. dig deeper, get the white stuff. fresher, newer. but not too new. when was it, ten years ago? 200 Cs?

Damn. Where is it?

no no no. not that one. nothing is right. it should be here. ok think, where were you when you saw it? not here. 

in the office, real clothes. cube sea, washing up and down with hands and heads. hard copy... copying. glancing at a page. header, top left. someone something, hereafter named blah, agrees to... to...

Meagan's here. something something, wants me to go with her. no i don't want to leave. any excuse. please. make it her idea. no really it's ok. see you tomorrow. right. please go away. 

empty office, late again. i was here for something, where is it? can i just...

No.

Stacy takes a breath, keeps her eyes closed. light outside won't go away. she looks. gray first, saturating. familiar bedroom things. right smell. right sounds. right thought, right action. well, not so much thought. already the contours of her dreams begin to fade. by her next breath she forgets them entirely. her mouth is dry, ache behind her eyes.

Today I have to pack, she says to the empty room. Tonight I will be in somewhere else.

the room says nothing. she nods to herself, gets up satisfied.



15.



the guy and amazon on the overpass, amazon goes idle, the guy takes the vehicle, sets off on his own.



\16. 

stacy packs, calls noma, noma is busy, they talk about the guy, noma gives a reason why she's helping him. something to do with his family. they all took the U.

17.

hello friend, maybe i'm not alone. this may be the last you hear from me. vague directions, when the sun is x, go y to z.

18.

noma searches the city.

19.

stacy travels to the new city, meets family, gets a call from virge.

20.

on his own, the guy encounters perils, overcomes... more or less.

21.

stacy goes to a meeting at the U, changing their dispo in the market, tags an engineer guy as a mark to squeeze for more info.

22.

hello friend. good things. better directions.

23.



??.

the guy wakes up in a tunnel of white smooth material, dirty with signs of frequent flooding, green overgrowth beyond. finds a blinking message on a screen, a corpse badly decomposed. hello friend...
