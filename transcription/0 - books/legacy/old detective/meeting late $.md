meeting late $










1.



wet streets, rain slicked windows, glossy lights, sloshing puddles. red sticky plastic barstool, counter thick with patina of  sweat and grease. stink of charred meat and a hint of fear.

the guy in the kitchen fries up a burger, some frozen protein and carbohydrates. the guy at the bar waits, looks around. no one else in here. what time is it? twelve minutes. a little longer, no burger. what time now? eleven minutes. ok. the waiting, you know the waiting part, he tells himself. chill, wait for your burger.

bells on the door jingle. guy at the bar looks up, doesn't turn around. click click of heels on the floor, walk to the neighboring stool. he feels a tingle of hairs on his arms, back of neck, against the ribs. a dark haired woman in skirt, suit. khaki, big sunglasses. she shakes water out of her repL, shuts it down. the tingling feeling dissipates. she removes her glasses, flash of LED green in her pupils, twinge of dark red on her lips.

You're early, she says.

Guess so, he says.

the guy in the kitchen brings a burger, fries, some limp greens, a basket of condiments, a mug of opalescent blue viscous fluid.

Thanks Steve, she says, taking the mug off the bar and holding it under her nose. Just how I like it.

the guy at the bar drags his plate over, eats a fry, crosses his arms. the woman slurps at her drink a little, stifles a burp, covers her mouth with one hand. when she drops her hand it goes to her bag. she produces a tab, thumbs it to life, swipes through some pages.

So you botched the Mercury gig. No, don't sweat it, we projected a 35 percent success rate. You brought back some good scans. We'll pay you the basic rate, just nothing extra. Your balance is updated. Good?

Fine. What's next?

she sucks at her mug for a bit, thumbing at her screen. Well you're looking a little soft on your monthlies. I want to see you get your numbers up. Did you do that training I sent you?

Yeah, I did it. Stupid. Wasn't anything I didn't know.

You don't have to like them, just get them done. With that last one I can bump you up 5 and get you some extra points. Maybe you can turn that into better percentage.

Whatever. Where are you sending me?

Mmm, let's see. Ceti Seven is up this week, Vega Two is down. Jupiter Sixteen is still topping the charts but you're gonna need at least a 96. Selibris Twelve is coming out of a slump, if you leave tonight could catch it before it flops again.

Come on, not S12 again. How many times did you send me out there last month?

That was two months ago, she says. she tosses back the last sticky vestiges in her mug, snaps her tab shut, grabs for her sunglasses. I have another appointment. 

Hey, we're not finished yet.

Yes we are. You don't want to do S12, that's fine. When something else comes up I'll push you.

You said I needed to get my monthlies up, how am I supposed to do that if you don't line me up on something else?

she grabs her bag, shoulders the straps, flicks on her repL. again he feels the tickling tugging on his skin.

What do you want from me? You need work, I give you work. Don't complain. Your balance would be in the shitter if not for me. Remind me again, how long was your cycle gonna be when we met? Twelve hundred years?

Whatever, fine, I'll take damn S12. 

I know. Pushed it to you already. You'll have exit clearance within the hour. Hey, Steve! Thanks for the tet! You say hi to Tina for me!

she leaves, taking her creepy repL with her. guy at the bar thinks, bitch, didn't anyone ever tell you it's rude to turn those things on inside? he eats another fry, pushes back the plate. he flips over the check, thumbs in a good tip, stands up and leaves. the door jingles again behind him. steve makes some congenial noise. the door slams.

Steve raises his eyebrows at door as the guy at the bar leaves in a huff, taking his rugged masculine self into the rain, leather and all. yeah, leather. Steve leans down on the counter, on his elbows, looking down at the fries. he squirts down two fat columns of ketchup before digging in. after eating half the fries he goes for the burger.

If I'da known I's making my dinner, I'da done a better job with this thing, he thinks. 

he thinks about the guy at the bar, his tanned red-faced sunglassed motorcycle jacket wearing self. looked like a dark tortured hero from a Bolly flick. competing in those games, kids do it these days to get rich quick. some make it, sure, but they all burn out real young. some of 'em take the U of course. they make enough for that sorta thing.

so his Rugged Manness will take himself down to his well furnished corner loft down on somewhere avenue, fab himself a drink, ponder the dark lit urban vista. probably take off his sunglasses, you know, to look soulful for the ladies, even if there's no ladies around. that's probably just his default state. he thinks deep rugged hero thoughts, unbuttons his shirt a little, spreads out in his favorite chair, loads up.

it's real awful what these kids do to themselves. they hook up these tubes and wires to their arms, like right at the wrist. then there's, you know, the stuff on their neck, the top of the spine. and at the bottom. good bare metal contact, they call it. you know, they get those implants. doesn't take that much money. got shops everywhere. you know, people's always lookin' to get modded.

but anyway, he hooks himself up to a Nutrifeed (TM), gets fabbed out calories and vitamins at regular intervals. everything, and i mean everything, gets recycled. yeah. so, the guy gets himself hooked up to all this stuff and goes and plays video games. yeah i know they got another name for it. and don't tell me you believe all the urban legends about those drones. 

no, they just ruin their bodies doing stupid stuff inside some simulation, turn some tricks, get theirs. i don't believe in the U myself, but most of those people swing that way...

Steve looks up from the wreckage of ketchup, lettuce, bread crumbs, wax paper. Well, hey, he thinks. That guy bought me dinner. Makes him good in my book.
