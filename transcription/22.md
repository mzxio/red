the work’s not done yet. that’s why i’m still here. will the work ever be done? will i just be left a ghost forever wandering, writing unseen messages on walls, in the circuits of whatever tech we have after this? will my ego dissipate and my starstuff (-will-) just be recycled across whatever void comes next? will i reincarnate and begin new work? until the universe ends, is the work ever really done? and even then, i just push the reset button and begin again. new universe, some slightly different rules, and then... go. no, the work’s not done yet. i am still here.

my only hope is 
that when the civil war starts
you and i
will still be
on the same side.
