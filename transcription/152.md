the city of three rivers. first time i came here was years ago. i still remember the creaking of the boat, coming into harbor. the spices and smoke and tar carried on the wind. rowdy sailors, down by the water. walking the terraced steps, the long stairs all the way from the docks to the top of the hill. the temple of the city’s patron saint. stopping for some kind of food i’d never had before, sold by a girl from somewhere i couldn’t identify. a thousand voices speaking five hundred tongues, bustling in the marketplace. we were all strangers, coming together here for all the other strangers, for the waters of the rivers, for the trade, for the food, for absolution. why did i come here? following the trail of some ancient quest. looking for something. a desire only ever out of reach, dragging me forward. i went to the temple on the hill. there i met the priests of the oldest order. i guess they recognized me or my kind, because they told me where i might look.
