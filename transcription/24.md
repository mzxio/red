dreams held the words, lost now.

driving 90 in the rain. slick country highways, long blind curves. to the town with the bridge, to the shore. rain and cold and wet and wind. enough to kill an umbrella. enough to soak you through. crackling return from deafness. there at the shore, at the edge of the world, go into the ocean. no shoes, no cares, or thatâ€™s how it should be. i missed what was happening until it was too late.
