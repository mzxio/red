### He walks into the bar.

he’s angry, furious. he clutches a gun under his clothes. he looks around. two women are over at the bar. they don’t see him but he knows one of them. she’s the one he’s here to kill. he walks behind her and pulls out the gun. he talks in angry broken sentences, quiet at first then louder until he’s screaming and hoarse. he insists that she has betrayed him, taken all his money. everyone in the bar is looking at him. he waves the gun and screams at them to stay. he wants them to see this woman, he wants them to listen. the other woman is calm, icy. she gets his attention. “hey, hey. are you sure about this? have you thought this through? is this really what you want?” he screams more. of course this is what he wants. “maybe i’ll do you after,” he says. “last chance,” she says. “walk away.” he points the gun at her friend. then he disappears. the bar is silent. everyone else is gone but the two women. the second turns back to the bar and finishes her drink in one go. the bartender comes back, like nothing happened. she takes away the glasses. the first woman is shaking and rooted, unseeing eyes. “what happened? where did he go?” she asks. “he was going to hurt you. i asked if he was sure. so i removed him.” “where? is he coming back?” “no. i have removed his memory and overwritten it. i cannot reconstitute him now. he won’t ever hurt you now.”
