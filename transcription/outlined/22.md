### Walk with care.

They’ll do business together, while each telling how you shouldn’t trust the other. They’ll lie out of both sides of their mouths. Laugh at you in your face while taking your money, your time, your life. You are not valuable to them the way they are to themselves.

You are a resource, something to be captured and exploited. If they can no longer exploit you, you may as well be dead.

They will make the stories to tell whoever comes next, and they won’t tell your story unless it can be made to benefit them. They’ll use you until it becomes too difficult, or expensive, then they will find someone or something else. Something less expensive.

Don’t be deceived by them. Don’t trust them. Don’t let them make you believe that they care, that they are your friend. They aren’t. They are only here for themselves.
