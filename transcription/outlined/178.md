### What happened to the ones who washed away? 

did any survive, swept off to some faraway place to start anew? or did they all die, their bones scattered under the river, tumbling out to sea? and if they’re gone, who will live to tell the story of us? we survived the trials of floods and snow and drought and thunder but now the village is burning. will we survive the test of flame? if we are all that’s left, what will be after us? no one will tell our stories. the valley will reclaim our farms, the rains will chip away at our walls. maybe one day someone will look upon this place and there will be no trace of us. will they know of the harvest of the great, when we received our blessing for the first year? will they tell of the flood when we lost half our number, when we had so mightily dishonored the great? will the flame take it all? we break ourselves on the fire to stop it, dredge the waters of the river to throw into the ravenous flames, senselessly, without thought. only actions now, what else is there to do? what else but to try? the flood won’t save us now. no one else will talk about us. no one will remember. so tonight we must beat the fire. there is no other way.
