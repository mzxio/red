### Taking trains to nowhere.

Staying on the express too many stops in the wrong direction. Keen and alert in a strange new place. Too far to walk back? Getting to the other platform. Waiting a long time for the train to go back to familiar streets.

That was the last train and itâ€™s late. Stuck looking for a safe place. Not straying far. The train station becomes the anchor to reality. If it disappears, maybe nothing ever existed at all.

This was always reality.
