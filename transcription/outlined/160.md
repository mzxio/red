### You don’t need a body.

It is possible to leave a body, go elsewhere, and then return. Some time will have elapsed for the body in your absence. One-to-one travel is easiest to perform but however long you were gone is also the amount of time elapsed for your body on your return. It’s possible to miss much, your body can carry on like you were never gone. A better ratio to attain gives an hour with only a few minutes’ cost. 

“And another thing...”

Don’t trust any landmarks. The universe is constantly in motion and we are entropy generators. Mountains and valleys can be relied upon for a while, but even they are not fixed. 

After travel you may find the meaning of words has changed. in all these cases it is difficult and limiting to always approach the world as if it is brand new to you, but overall it is best not to make assumptions about where you are.
