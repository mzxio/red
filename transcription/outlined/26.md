### Friends, enemies, people yet to be.

Scenes in forests, bedrooms, long hallways and glass buildings. The shadow of towers falls across the woods. We walk under the trees. You ask me questions. I tell you stories.

We move from scene to scene, across the old bridge and the empty playground. Pine needles and dusty buildings. Not my stories to tell but you want to hear them anyway. Our voices ring off the trees. Forever doesnâ€™t seem so long.

Always has to be someone to take the fall.

 I wake and I want to tell you but there is no way.
