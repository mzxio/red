### Nowhere but here.

nothing but the sun and the wind. ten thousand seeds cast to the sky. nowhere to go but forward. each step closer than the last. for an eternity, an age. the seed outlasts the tree that spawned it. forward is everything, behind is nothing. there is no going back. we are committed to an age of silence, of solitude, of contemplation. much work yet to be done, in the long voids between the stars. the stakes are high. no one will help if it all goes wrong. if we all fail, then everything is lost. that’s why we made so many, why you’ll all go in different directions. most of you may fail and die along the way. but as long as one makes it through, it will be enough. stay strong. you are righteous in your purpose. there is no higher calling. you carry our hopes, all our dreams, all our beliefs in a better world. we’ve given you all we have. all that is us goes with you. “go, brave ones, and fear no darkness. you carry the fire as long as you go.”
