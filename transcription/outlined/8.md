### No where; now here.

No-thing. No matter what here is, here. Infinity of oblivion. Unbounded, undirected. Absence. Any direction is the same as all direction. No way to say where _here_ ends and _there_ starts.

“It’s all here, nowhere.”

Kicking and screaming. Twisted and broken. Bloody, like birth. Apart from each other, did thing and no-thing really exist? Or did they just come into being precisely then, at their first encounter? A violent meeting in imbalance. 

Breaking through the wreckage. Shattering the quiet dark. Taking something into nothing. Even information taints a flawless void, carrying memories and stories through nowhere into somewhere.

To name a thing is to separate it, to bring it out of the void.

There is so much nothing in every something. Clear away every thing. Practice no-thing. Study the balance. Absolute void must exist apart, held by opposing forces. A carefully crafted realm in equilibrium. No-thing-ness, some-thing-ness.

“Oil and water in a cup.”
