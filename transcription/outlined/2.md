### It begins by the fire, in howling darkness.

Mysteries. Visions. Unknowable space past space. Existence. Degrading memory. Eternal life recovered pieces without context. Infinite light emerging. 

Waking dreams. Plains, mountains, valleys, canyons, rivers, cities. A palace, a garden, a boat. Sanctuary. Culture. Arrangements in continuum. Meanings changing, narratives twisting. Moving on. Forgotten relics. Pieces of history. Bones and dust. 

"There’s always still hope, so — I love you."
