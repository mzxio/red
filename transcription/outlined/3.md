### Desert. Void.

Infinite desolation. Choices made this land. Nothingness and potential, there, just out of reach. Beyond the horizon. Hidden life revealed. Waiting at the shore.

We begin by the fire, beset by darkness. Flame reflected in our eyes dulls the light of distant stars. We take up the fire for ourselves. We observe cycles, honor ancient ceremonies, sing in old ways. Laughter rings out at the end of sorrow.

“Don't know where, don't know when.”

Sun traverses sky, horizon to horizon, day upon day. We rise up and fall again. Years pass in shuddering seasons. Wind and water etch their marks upon the face of the earth. We carry the fire.

"Upon entering such a universe, there is no way to return.”
