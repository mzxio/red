### Mesa country.

the ones who came here didn’t want to be found. in the long canyons, far from the sea, far from the fertile croplands. why did they come so far? what were they escaping? some say these lands weren’t always so desolate, that great rivers flowed through the canyons. that the fields blossomed all year long. the ones who came here weren’t running from anything, but following the rivers into special valleys where they could live forever. they say things changed. the rivers started flowing in different ways. then there were no more rivers. no more fields. almost everything and everyone died in famine and dust. the ones who are here now, they’re just the ones that survived. they say there’s still one river, one valley, one village untouched. somewhere in these canyons, beyond the still plains and the desolate mesas, somewhere in all of that, someone is alive. ancient, forgotten. wherever they are, they have answers for me.
