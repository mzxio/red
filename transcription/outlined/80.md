### What is there to hope for?

We created a myth centuries ago. It tells of so-and-so doing something worth remembering.

We keep the myth alive, breathing in our ears since before this place even existed. My ancestors came to this land and carried it with them. Stories like nearly immortal beings, like the gods of old. 

Stop praying to them, stop telling the myth, and soon both will be lost to time.

As long as we live and take it with us, the myth endures. My ancestors and their ancestors, all the way back until there is no memory, to a time when only the myth still remembers any of who we were. 

My ancestors knew the myth and carried it on their longest trip, the one they took to come here. I will never know their names but I can tell it like they did. The ancestors may be kept alive even after they are lost and forgotten.
