### Who says we deserve to live?

What does that mean, to be deserving of life?

If we are God’s children, whose god is that? We are the children of our own mythology. Titans battling in whatever pastiche of oral history they sing their children to sleep. What does that say for the children of those stories?

We deserve to live because we say we do? Destroying, pillaging, raping, murdering, stealing. Our life above all others?

Somewhere in our bones we know it’s true. We are children of the divine. We are thoughtless matter rendered thoughtful. We know that makes us special, important.

More important than other thoughtful matter? More important than the exquisite art that nature creates?

If we do indeed deserve to live, do we deserve to kill others to make that life? 

Is any life worth our own?
