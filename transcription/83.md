#83

walking down the old train tracks. most everyone’s gone home. it’s the evening or the weekend or all of the above. the sun hasn’t quite set. the idle part of the day between afternoon and night. the part of town with rundown old buildings, still in use, junkyards and overgrown weeds. places between the fences to slip through, places to hide. some days there’s needles under the trees. some days it’s bottles and sleeping bags. some days it’s old men with bicycles riding in caravans. no one today. going around the edge of a loading dock, through the gravel and overgrown grass. there’s a man and his dog i see down here sometimes. set up on a scaffold with a lawn chair. watching the day, watching his property. i try to go around, don’t want to cut through like usual. he stops me, yells something about why would i want to walk so far out of my way. i tell him i didn’t want to upset him or the dog. he shakes his head, shakes my hand, leads me through the doors. (his hand is dry, dirty.) on my hand there’s dirt and grease now, staining where he touched my shoulder. a sign of hard work and friendship. i smell the grease and sweat and it is the most precious thing in that evening light.
