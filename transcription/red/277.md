the place of bones. ancient trials. the hill overlooking the old town, the rolling farm land. there are littered the bones of the ones found guilty of whatever crimes, subject to whatever punishment. here the justice is swift and grotesque. that’s why this is the place of bones. left over and comingled, shards of the accused. victims of another sort. who is without sin? the ancient legends tell of someone who died on a hill such as this, overlooking a town. they said that in his name we are all absolved of our sins, that his death bought passage for everyone to a better place in the hereafter. no ancient death absolves me of my sin. casting back and recalling fully there is no reason i should stand here as witness and not accused. there is no reasons for my bones to be intact while these souls crunch underfoot. these should be my bones. or maybe that’s the point of the ancient stories. the cosmos takes us all, no matter what.
