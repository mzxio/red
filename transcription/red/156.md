inside was the key.

both versions of reality. the one that was, the one that is. what became and what could have been. i know what i chose (...) because it’s what i always chose. too late to go back and change it. lock down the other reality. destroy it when you have a chance. as long as it exists there is a risk. contamination of the timeline. what is, is. what isn’t should not be. only as a relic of another universe, and then it is dangerous. keep it hidden. the fewer who know the better. if this gets loose it could change everything. better no one ever knows.
