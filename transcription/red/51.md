taking trains to nowhere. the express one too many stops in the wrong direction. getting off someplace you’ve never been and walking around. too far to walk back? getting back on the other platform, keen and alert in a new place, maybe waiting a long time for the train to take you back where you know the streets. maybe it was the last train and it’s late and you’re stuck looking for a safe place. going to what’s familiar, not straying too far. the train station becomes the anchor tethering you to reality. if it disappears, maybe the world you remember never existed at all. this was always your reality.
