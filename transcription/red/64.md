we were the survivors. not the ones that anyone cared about. not the special ones. not the princes and princesses, not the leaders, not the nobles. we walked around the edges, stood at the back, kept quiet. mostly, until we didn’t. then there were a few of us. some of us picked the losing side in a conflict and we lost them. they were right but they lost anyway. i tried to save them but i secretly wished i was brave enough to be one of them. then we were few. i gained the leaders’ respect and they afforded us some indulgences. shelter, equipment, weapons. we became the guard, nominally unaligned, serving whoever needed us. i set up watches. i had a good second in command. i didn’t have to tell him what to do, he just did it anyway. then we marched, endlessly moving. we were in space. we were on the ground. then it all went wrong. so hard to remember now. i remember losing someone. she was there and then she wasn’t. she walked out of her quarters when no one was looking and never came back. but i know she was killed. how? i don’t know. someone killed her. one of the nobles. had to be. they wanted us all dead. after i watched the uprising, the purge, i couldn’t let it continue. then that’s all i did. watch. talk. the rest of us made it. the guard continued. we rebuilt. instead of taking over ruins we built our own places. still after she was gone it was never the same. not for me. we were just survivors.
