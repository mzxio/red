they won’t hear what they don’t want to. the beliefs that agree with them the most will be the beliefs they hold. anything outside gets pushed farther away. they build their walls high, make their rules long and too complex for anyone else to understand. they wallow in their unreal universe whose only real value is its constant agreement with their vision. they won’t see changes when it happens. little by little they fall completely out of step with the reality they have to share. they spend all their time inside the walls, like there’s nothing outside. when their final crisis comes, they’ll almost be too surprised to do anything about it. and nothing will break the walls by then. they’ll suggest ideas, maybe even dismantling their safe alternate reality, but those voices will be drowned out. in self preservation they’ll make crazy attempts at life and fail all the harder.
