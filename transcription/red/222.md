the same dreams, again and again. escaping lockdown. the wet woods. the empty farm house. no power, no connection, no way to call out. running. stuck in mud. sliding down the hill. digging in the leaves. the long dress gets caught. the road, the trucks, the men. back to lockdown.

the blue light in the darkness. accelerating. crushed. a fractal tower. vehicles. one carries a secret, one will be escape. the column moves, all the vehicles shift, there are never any fewer. they go on forever. none contains the secret. grab one and go. get out.

the forever darkness. a howling wind. broken on the rocks. the wind isn’t howling, it’s creatures in the night, beyond the light from the fire. can’t move. they come closer. howls upon howls. they want to kill. they are hungry. they’ll eat me alive. then she appears, a stick held up, flaming, swinging at the creatures. starving feral wolves, giant and terrible. she has her back to me. she fights them, driving them away.
