how can you tell if anything is good or bad? it seems easy. good stuff is good. it’s whatever you want it to be. bad stuff is bad. you just know. but what about when something that seemed good turns out bad, or the other way around? if it starts as one and ends as the other, (was) it ever really either? i guess that’s the point of the farmer with the horse. he doesn’t take either, just assumes both at all times. and what then is the truth? it too is changeable over time. or any other state that may not always hold its shape. because one day i will be dead but now i am alive enough to write. does that mean i was always dead? always alive? maybe the problem is in the always. nothing is ever one thing forever. in the old stories the gods are always malleable, always changing their minds or their bodies. what then if we an’t count on the divine, what can we count on? is there ever a wellspring of eternal goodness or are we always going through the cosmos looking over our shoulder?
