# 172

we didn’t meet anyone on the road. leaving the cities, pointing into the heart of desolation. we thought we’d see at least someone out there, someone else fleeing the cities, someone tracing an idle circuit between towns. past the old ports of entry, back when there were still borders, back when someone still cared enough to enforce them. rugged buildings ready for war, long empty and silent. past the old fuel stations where they would stop and rest and fill up their machines with whatever they used to run on. past the lonely overpasses, bridges over the turns into whatever hidden settlements used to lurk just behind those hills. then finally coming to the mountain pass, now and forever blocked by a rock slide. have to take the long way round. these days no one comes up here to fix it. the roads go back to trails, worn down by passage of the few like us who still walk.
