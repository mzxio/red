# 120

i don’t know if this is getting anywhere. for a while it seemed like something was coming through. now, no. all a slog to get anything down, and then it seems hollow, empty of meaning. like i’m forcing it. can’t always be a perfectly tuned receiver i guess. or maybe i can be and my choices are depriving this experience of meaning. in either case it seems like the only option is to keep showing up. for 120 days so far, if it’s 120 more who’s to say? that overall i will have conveyed more than i have so far? or does the inspiration stop here and it’s nothing but self referential inanity from here all the way down? i feel that if i just keep doing it there is a chance, but if i stop there will be no chance. still it bothers me that after four months of no late night creation cravings that once again i find myself at midnight wishing and yearning to make something more. for a time this was enough. no longer. that’s upsetting because the midnight cravings seem to be no good just a form of desperation, something to be fixed elsewhere.
