the ancient ones blessed yeast bearers, so they say. beer makers. bread makers. partners with organisms that wouldn’t have the names we call them for an age of the old world. that didn’t stop the bread or the beer or the wine or any of the thousand sour vegetables resting in pots in cool cellars or buried in the earth. a cold fire, someone called it. cooking without cooking. the invisible beings take that carefully prepared raw ingredient and turn it into something good and ready to eat or drink. generation upon generation, cultivating, experimenting, learning what organisms for the best preparation. partnering with these life forms that share the air and the earth, without us ever knowing. they will wait on every surface, every grape, every stalk of wheat. some are ready to kill us, and they do just that with great regularity. some, i suspect most, don’t kill but instead they help. a kind of domestication, a cultivation. but at heart they will still be wild and free. we think this is our world and they are helping us, but in fact it’s probably their world and we give them something to do with their time.
