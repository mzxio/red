new place, new rules. the recurring nightmares are over, or is the start of a new nightmare? the controller brought us here. i am here, she is here, the stranger is here. she seems different. awake for the first time since before. she is disoriented, confused. the stranger too. we are not as we were. we have bodies, faces, clothes. i have a body. what is this body? it fits as i imagined it, but i had no body before. did i? i can no longer trust memory. the controller is rewriting our histories. dizzy. i see her. she sees me. we take a step and stumble, fall into each other. we hold on. i feel the stranger. his touch is gentle. he steadies us both. he asks “do i know you?” no. i look at her again. she seems bigger than before. stronger. less afraid. “you” she says. “i  remember you. is it you?” yes. the stranger steps back. he sees where we are. a big room with tables and chairs, long windows overlooking a city skyline. a bar with bottles and glasses. someone comes around from a back room, takes an empty glass from the bar. not the controller, the controller’s avatar. “welcome” it says. “sit anywhere you like. can i get you something to start?” she is holding my body’s arm. my arm. the stranger is looking for the exits. but he doesn’t move. they all look at me. they expect an answer. the controller is watching. there’s a table by the window, by the exit. i say “we’ll take it over there.”
