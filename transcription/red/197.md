taking off. flying between cities of the old world. before any crash there has to be a launch. before any remembering there must be experiencing. before any ending there must be a beginning. they say a thousand years ago there were no flying machines. ten thousand years from now our machines will still be flying. the old ones too, the ones without a mind of their own. dumb machines lost in the void, holding the smallest memories of where they came from. lost forever. messages in bottles cast to the seas. junk, but junk with a purpose. forward down the runway. charge the engines, in crease thrust, push against drag and friction and gravity and all the things that would keep you down. push harder, faster, until speed and lift meet and the pressure on the wings build and the bumping of the wheels on the tarmac become less frequent, optional. the plane wants to fly, it wants to be off the ground and in the air. even without its own mind, it knows where itâ€™s supposed to be.
