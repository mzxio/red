what’s between nowhere and somewhere? how would you know when you got there? does nowhere become somewhere while we’re standing in it? standing, sitting, driving, crawling, whatever. so many different experiences. nowhere -- the gateway to heaven. we all pass through here on our way, one at a time. the river styx becomes a dusty creek. the ferryman is the driver who drops you off. he used to drive the boat but after global warming and the sharing economy, now he drives for uber. 

losing perspective, the shapes get (-harder- more difficult). more dreamlike. can’t tell what is in or out. forced perspective, overemphasis. bridge over a stream, doorway in a hall? where am i?
