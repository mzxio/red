the pilgrim doesn’t think about much. the pilgrim walks and sleeps, stops when necessary, eats when it’s time, looks for water, follows the land. the pilgrim doesn’t worry, only concerned with the way forward. the shape of the land. the wind and hills. plants. what can be eaten, the pilgrim will know. there is no thinking about other places, other people, other things. just the path and the land, the sun, the weather. one ridge line to the next. fuel for the fire. shady places on hot days, safe places at night. the pilgrim has no need to speak but to pray. there is a devotion, a few words to repeat again and again, by the fire, at the dawn, in the night, at noon. ritual to mark the time and a pious attitude. there are no needs for other thoughts. the pilgrim could traverse all these lands with nothing else. carry a little, go far. sometimes there’s a beast of burden or a cart or a companion, but most days not. the pilgrim doesn’t turn them away but they go in their own time. the pilgrim doesn’t need to worry, there is only the way forward. the pilgrimage. there is a destination. where it is is unknown. what it is the pilgrim will know. the only choice is to go and keep going until it is found. that is the pilgrim’s way.
