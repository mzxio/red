old people hanging out at an old store. like they’ve been there forever. the people, the store. time seems to sink and slow, darker, quieter, cooler. “someone turn up the heat!” they’ll say. the young folk will sweat and swelter any time they come in. the people will be grumpy, seem uninterested. they’ve been here forever. forever for you, maybe. but they were here for every day of it. they can reach out to all those times if you cared enough to listen. your forever is an afternoon for them. that’s why they seem so uninterested in talking. they’ve heard most anything you could ever say. they’ve heard it before. what could you have that would interest them? do you remind them of their children, perhaps? people from long ago? it doesn’t look it now, but back then they looked like you and your friends looked like their friends. no use telling it. youth is spent on the young. one day maybe you’ll be sitting here too.
