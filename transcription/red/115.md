walking into an empty place to live alone forever. everyone else far away, on another continent mostly. maybe someone within walking distance, a few weeks’ journey. someone to trade with once or twice a year, friends from a past life. eventually then one day there is no visit. they will wait for the arrival and there is none. maybe it’s been years and the friends are old and their children make the trip(.) maybe for the first time, maybe retracing some old paths unseen since childhood, until they finally find the place, and maybe some corpse in bed or on the shitter or half eaten outside on a field somewhere. and that’s it. solitude until the end. someone said that nature self selects for cooperation, that the loners take themselves out of the running when something happens to them that they need help to escape but with no help they die. maybe that’s me. maybe that’s all the loners who walk into the wilds and are never seen again. something eventually kills us all but some things kill us sooner, some things kill us unnecessarily. maybe it’s ok.
