i remember going over the top. waited for the chance. he had an RPG or something. why weren’t they covering him? there were two other guys. in the foxhole. with him. we were on our side. they were hitting us hard. was it mortars? i just remember the exploding and the count. the grenadier was slow. left us time between. that’s when i went over. three guys. it’s like they were surprised to see me. it’s like i’m flying over them and the mortar guy is fumbling with the tube and the other guys are falling over themselves with their guns. i must have killed them all.
