can’t remember. memory can’t be trusted. illusion everywhere. forgetting. too many universes. too much traveling. it all runs together. unending. once i forgot the forgetting. they called that “childhood.” playing games.

a grid of spaces. players occupy one space each. they can move to other spaces using special rules. they can be in the same space together. they can interact with each other across spaces with signals or weapons. the object of the game is survival. you survive by destroying all your opponents, or by reaching agreements with them, or escaping. the win state is subject to change. where i come from they call this “house rules.” house rules are whenever you make up your own rules and don’t do what the rules of the game tell you to do. the game is just a set of pieces, you can move them however you please and assign any meaning you choose. add new pieces or take away old ones. write your own rules, make your own pieces. the game isn’t what anybody tells you it is, it’s what you make of it. we all make up our own rules. sometimes we use someone else’s rulebook and stick by it. other times there are no rules. or are there? who else is playing?
