what do we take with us? then wasn’t all that different from now. who would you be in any other time? all the same. pieces realign, the whole doesn’t change. follow the trail set before you, glittering in the darkness. follow the mother’s tears, scattered on the wind. follow whatever the fuck you’re going to follow. it may not matter what you chose, destiny may have already chosen. if you don’t have a choice, what do you choose? there is another way. fly against destiny, fly until there are no more choices. fly and fly until the last of you is spent and all that supported you is exhausted. fly headfirst into the void and fear no darkness. fly until all words lose meaning and the universe itself is nothing but a faint glow on the horizon. fly until the ages of your world are spent.
