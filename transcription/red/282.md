the longest day. before anyone else knew, we knew. we knew all of this world was crumbling, washing out to sea. we drove like driving was all there’s ever been. we drove like our lives depended on it. we went farther than we’d ever gone. we knew we had to make a new world. fingers entwined, hand in hand, we raced into that new world, grabbing at anything we found along the way. later that world will burn and all that made it good will shrink and wither and die. like all worlds, eventually. ours was not to be. not for long. an illusion. paper over unchecked depths. an impossible divide. inside was enough to start again, to make another world. instead we lived our last moments on the road. a universe created and destroyed in just a few days, and the universe that came rushing in to fill its empty space. and we were lost.
