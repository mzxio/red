it isn’t where we are, it’s where we aren’t. in the infinite, there is no isn’t. everything is is. in isn’t we find ourselves, our identities, our egos, our places. isn’t knows love and loss. it knows now, it knows here. isn’t cuts away all the extra information and leaves nothing but the smallest piece of is, the one piece we get to hold. what is something? start with what it’s not , or start with the infinite. start with process, with verb. maybe it’s any manner of thing, or everything. do you know? can you? we are children of isn’t. we don’t know what we don’t know. the infinity we start with is the infinite of nothing. we dream of infinite something. of infinite is. we say that is our hereafter. our mythology tells of the all-being who comes from is. but even in so doing, we make the all-being an isn’t just like us. all the isn’t, together, when there is nothing left, they become forever. just on the other side of infinite nothing is infinite something. you are the all-being, here and now. everything else, everything extraneous, isn’t. (-so-) you can have infinite is in infinitesimal isn’t.
