they came to me looking for help. she was nervous and angry, excited. he was uncomfortable, exhausted, didn’t want to be there. she poured out a story that didn’t make a lot of sense. he seemed embarrassed, powerless, consigned. i started to answer but realized i misunderstood. i asked her to clarify. he seemed relieved. she told me about his job, about its conditions. where they worked, what they ate. there was a big worry about the bread they made in his cafeteria. and how the slightest accident would kill everyone. he seemed to be a miner. i told him there was nothing for it but to talk to everyone. “buddy,” i said, “you gotta get political.”
