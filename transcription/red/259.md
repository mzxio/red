it wasn’t there where anyone would see it, not right away. look around, between the cracks. they’ll tell you who they are. the same spirit moves in them. almost. same spirit, different motion. different choices. everyone will say one thing and do another. don’t trust their words. trust their words. you have to decide. if they tell you who they are, listen. listen even if you hear something you don’t like. don’t try to make up a different story that you like better. if the story you hear is an ugly story, tell an ugly story. don’t shy away from the truth when they bring it to you. their truth doesn’t have to be your truth. so long as you both live the same universe, their truth may change your reality. so make sure you know what they are about, it may be life or death to know what they are about. trust no one, believe everyone. you’re not smart enough to know the difference, you can’t know for sure until later. assume everything is in motion. the true form of things will eventually be revealed.
