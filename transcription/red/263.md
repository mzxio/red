they killed us all. the guardians in the north, dead. in the east, dead. in the south, dead. in the west... dead. all dead. they came and wiped us out and none of them did anything to stop it. they rolled over us like the floods, like the fires, like the earthquakes, like the tornados. everywhere we were, they came. if we were there, they killed us. some stayed low, behind the protectors. some survived. they moved us from where we were. the land was good, they wanted it for themselves. they gave us a choice, trust them to rule or die. we didnâ€™t trust, but what choice did we have? they exterminated us, starting with the strong. if we were to live at all it had to be under their laws, which always changed when they wanted more. and they always wanted more. when the bad land they gave us turned out to be full of riches for them to steal, they took the land and sent us away. then came the day there was nowhere else for us to go. \<|\>
