sometimes now doesn’t make sense until later. rushing headlong into tomorrow, being out of sync. the old farmer greets each day, every piece of the news with a quiet skepticism. “maybe,” he says. maybe it’s good, maybe it’s bad. won’t know until later. besides, we break things into neat little manageable pieces: past, present, future. why? because that is how we see? but it isn’t. we are all time travelers, visiting past and future as easily as the present. in fact more easily. the masters of the present seem to get their ability to be here only after discipline and study. why do we cling to this rigid view? cause does not always precede effect. i can change things that i can’t even touch.
