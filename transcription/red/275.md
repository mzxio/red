little by little, time takes it all. first the memories. the smells, the sounds, the exact shape of things. it leaves the feelings. then it takes more. artifacts break, degrade, get lost. it all ends up in the trash, at the wayside. the shape of things changes so there’s no way to reconstruct the exact scene. impossible to put the pieces back together. eventually it’s only the feeling left, a wisp of old music recovered from some archived recording. just memory overwritten so many times even its configuration, the arrangement, is in doubt. and only the smallest feeling, warmth in the heart from a sun long gone, a season long past. anniversaries are the hardest. swimming in just the feelings, drowning in what’s left of memory, wishing for just one more moment.
