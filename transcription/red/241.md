a dream of white sand and silver water along the empty shore.

the house, the house. more secrets than it originally revealed. what was the point? puzzles in layers upon layers.

woods. the hut, the well, the shore. bones and clues and scraps. harvest them all to unlock everything, or not. the forest is quiet and still. everyone holds breath.

the boat, the vessel, the conveyance, the arrow to shoot into the final act.

something in the water. chemicals? spills? monsters?

what was at the island? my vision ended at the steps down into dark damp  wet cold hole, down and down and down. maybe thatâ€™s just how the story goes. we never know what went on down there.
