they say the devil is in the details.

ship minds, cast of characters in their own right. pod mind is aftermarket, modded, older. truck mind is vanilla, corporate, a snitch. not to be trusted. pod mind is much older than the rest, at least 15-20 years before the others. the relay station mind is just a node in the network, a dumb passthrough with quirks born out of boredom. resets every day but there are some traits it’s learned to store and restore when necessary. mother mind is a deep clone of a vast library. that’s how the pod mind ends up in the mother’s sim. they didn’t know how much she’d need so they gave her everything.

none of the ships are made for many people. mother has no facilities except for some small quarters for one or two. maintenance, emergency, visitors. truck can carry up to 120 but only outfitted for one ‘supervisor’ and 3-4 crew. mostly they run with one. pod is only for one or two max, very cramped space to fly in. the bigger ships run on minds alone, people are incidental. star ships never needed crews like sailing ships. by then we were relegated to the back seat.
