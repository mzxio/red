cause and effect have infinite configurations. no one decision leads directly to any one outcome, any exact consequence. at the beginning we cannot see the end with perfect certainty. so it goes that we can make mistakes at any time for any reason. we have our rules, our ideas of order and justice, our feelings of hurt and betrayal made a mockery of by prescience of the future. so we travel back to find things like motive, intent. travel forward to find damage, outcome. and in our tidy little justice we seek balance(,) that hollow equality when the scales are in alignment. vengeance, justice: a hot angry balance, or a cold detached balance. we try to make sense of chaos and madness with order and rationality, even when we ourselves are disordered irrational beings. when remembering, we remember imperfectly. we remember the highs, the loudest, the best. we remember the end. the messy ruin. we travel an imperfect record of time looking for answers. finding none we invent gods whose task is the impossible. weight a heart against a feather.
