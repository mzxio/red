crossing the threshold. first the ramp up, a deep rumble and a whine. the drive spools up. the universe puckers, pinches the ship. g-forces, both forward and back. pure weightless. weightless like the absence of all gravity. even subtle perturbations of distant stars. then the rush forward. “forward” is relative, entirely based on point of view. all directions are forward, but the ship goes forward. the jump. the pinch, squeeze, acceleration without motion. a blast of light, radiation, pure energy. blue-white. the stars seem to stretch, just an illusion. the last of their light drawn out. a ragged shaken disturbance at the edges of view. a great noiseless noise. the jump, crossing over. then it’s over. jumped. the other side, swirling energy, disturbances in the flow show gravity, other invisible bodies beyond. impossible speed past speed, rushing forward, ploughing into infinity. space folding, hyperspace. many names, one place within the fields of the universe, invoked with a single word: jump.
