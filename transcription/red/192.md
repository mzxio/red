the ancient legends tell of a boy, born of both mortal and divine. his coming was foretold. wanderers followed the stars to the place of his birth. for an age his birth was celebrated as the coming of light in the darkest time of the year, as the salvation of all. in the legends, his passing washed away the old sins and treachery from the time of creation of that world, when divine forces moved openly under the new sun, across the young world. all the days of his life he served the poor, the sick, the ones who could not speak for themselves. he wandered a small corner of that world, sharing his good news. he led a movement against the strong governors of that age. a staunch group of believers in peace against the violence and domination of those rulers. of course the rulers could never allow that to stand so they killed him with their most public means of execution. they nailed him to a wooden cross on top of a hill, a warning to all the rest. his followers said that he would come back one day, that in his death he had purified all people and returned to the divinity from which heâ€™d come. gradually his followers subverted the rulers and went on to found a great empire that spanned the world and entered for millennia. as far as anyone knows, he never came back. at least not in a way they agreed upon. somewhere out there, they still wait. but he came to us once. i think that was enough.
