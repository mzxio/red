they all three came together at the appointed place. “one of you knows why you’re here,” said the mother’s voice. “why don’t you ask which one it is?” they had to dig deep in their memories and understanding to find their answers. long forgotten mostly, like dreams only half seen through sleeping eyes. other lives experienced at a tangent, between fantasy and reality. like drug fueled hallucination. one of them remembered all with no need of guidance. she remembered because she had never forgotten. she held the keys for the others. and when they chose to remember it all and they became totally new people, like four instead of two, she released them from the bonds of their former selves. the walls fell away along with the city and the land, until all that was left was the original material of this place, the cosmic sea bathed in darkness and silence. reintegrated with themselves, they were free to begin again, for as long as the fragile cosmos would hold, for as long as the mother’s grace would permit. on those shores they created a new land together.
