miles from wherever. no transmissions this far out. some days they come strong, blasting over every channel. times like now, nothing. too weary to receive, to go out looking for more. just a pause. not every day is transcendent epiphany. some days are just walking through the desert and nothing special is going on. only to appreciate the light and the shapes of the earth, the changing scenery, moving through the world at walking speed, no beasts, no machines. slow. unfolding. the mountains appear as shadows, then as hills, and there from atop those hills, distant peaks. the ravines get in the way, have to go around for miles to find another path, miles more to get back on course. what is the course now? same as it ever was. that way. onward. after the mountains there will be more desert, plains, rivers, all the way to the sea. how long will it take to walk there? later. we’ll get there. later. if we keep walking. or just lie down right here and die. let the small desert creatures get at you. they don’t mind, you’d be doing them a favor. you’d keep them fed for at least a week, maybe more, maybe less. if they start fighting over your bones. maybe later. but now now. just keep walking.
