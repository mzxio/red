an unspoken promise to return. how long was it? stopped counting so long ago. black hairs turned gray. years if there were years. decades if there were decades. it all runs together now. a lifetime. when he lands in the plains and comes out to meet us he too is gray and old just like we became. a little different. our paths diverged all those years ago. he walked a different road. we’ll never know. still he kept the promise, returned for us. now we have to decide. go with him into his world and leave our own? or would he stay? no he won’t stay. we go or we stay. our choice. after so long, didn’t think there would ever be a choice, not really. the distant hopes remained ever distant and in the end having no choice became a kind of comfort. we knew where we’d always be. i see how he looks at us. he wishes our roles were reversed. weight of all those years.
