the last jump. charging. plot your course. your ship will break after this. wherever you end up, there is where you’re going to stay. choose well. can you even choose well? millennia of stellar observations, catalogs, indices, you know all you can know. could it ever be enough? no one else is coming. just you, your know, whatever and whoever you brought with you. and how much loss? who should here but isn’t, lost along the way? who more than anyone else do you wish was here now? doesn’t matter now. can’t change the past. can’t go back now. charging. do the calculations. reference, coordinated, projection. charging. you’ve known for a while this was where you were headed. but now, waiting in anticipation, death rushing up from behind. all the hope and fear from such long epochs of travels all focused ahead, and nothing to do but wait and check your calculations again and again. charging. not long now. the accumulators are almost full, straining to do their task this one last time. ready now. jump.
