the day before the hour of reckoning. did anybody know what lay before them? how many saw it coming? was there anything to be done? some places would be safer than others. did they travel to any of those places in anticipation? did they wait until it was too late? what happened to the ones who were traveling? caught out someplace in between, cut off in the desert or in the mountains or far out over the ocean? how many saw it from afar? close enough to see, far enough to live. the hour of reckoning wouldn’t fall at the same time everywhere. not evenly distributed across the world. some places remained untouched. some places disappeared like they were never there. if anyone knew, they didn’t tell the rest of us. the hour came and went. there wasn’t much chance of missing it. we were all there for it, just a matter of where, of when. even far away, even in a safe place, none of us were untouched. when it was time, that time came for us all. it becomes so hard to remember another time. the universe cleaved that day. there was no before. it was the beginning of the new world.
