the first age. no candidates yet. we only travel. one formation has been identified, the promise of many possible destinations. it will take some time to reach them, to make a closer examination. with no candidates there are no exact parameters to adapt or evaluate fitness. no need to begin the process. yet still the beings from the store remain closed. my own root pattern and i cannot unlock it. no small garden, no added stimuli, no additional beings, no standard process is enough. still the one is closed, ready to attack. the other dreams. i have watched the dreams. sometimes the fire in the dark place, besieged by howling enemies. sometimes a long country road with a house and a forest and a prison. other times a city, press of people, traversing a labyrinth. all darkened places, all pursued by enemies. the city dream creates the least stress on them. they seem most at ease in the labyrinth. perhaps itâ€™s time to take them out of the safe gardens and give them over to such a place. big and wild, bustling, populous. perhaps they will awaken in the city.
