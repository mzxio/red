isn’t there one among you who holds the keys? ten million howling souls in bedlam and only one gate -- one way in, one way out. so who is it? who do you trust with the keys of your wretched kingdom? who decides who goes and who stays? who sleeps in the gatehouse? who keeps away the hordes at the gate? and when hell is full, where do you put the wailing masses? do you leave them on the fields, between worlds, between countries, the seething crawling infinite purgatory? unwanted in life, unwanted in death, a product of meddlesome beings more powerful than they could ever be, those useless bugs given soul but no purpose, left in the garden to fend for themselves and kicked out of heaven for daring to ask why? what will you do, oh devil, what will you do with the children of industry? what will you do with the millions of casualties? god doesn’t want them, god left a long time ago. you know that, devil, as no one else does. you were there, weren’t you, at god’s final judgement? and what a lazy judgement it was. the creator tired of creation and went off to create another. and you, devil, left to pick up the pieces, left to tend to god’s children. if only you cared more, if only god had made you to understand and not punish, not to be the judge of our souls. you don’t have a soul, oh devil, you are older than souls. yet still you hold the keys to all our (ascension/ascensions). let us go. open the gates and let us quit this wretched place. let us be free.
