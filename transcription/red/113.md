it all comes back around again. as from the beginning, so to now. nothing really changes, whatever it was that drove you then still drives you. whatever you were searching for, you’re still searching. whatever it was. you’ve found some pieces but never the whole. it seemed so random, a brownian motion of searching by bumping into things and then moving on. they say you shouldn’t be that way, but what if that’s the way this happens? what if the child self knows but the adult self has to spend long years learning and articulating? what if we know our destiny but only through living it out is that knowing expressed? later, in any case, we can say “i knew it would be like this” whether or not it’s true, regardless of the presence or absence of destiny. but for me, coming back around again. this seems as it should be. starting at one place and learning and working in a big circle. it seems i started with a low fidelity polygonal simulation, cruising through space. and now at last i am the maker of the sim, not just a player.
