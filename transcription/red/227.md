we are not as we seem. external reality is not internal reality. what is inside is not always outside, and so on. only the being enclosing a space can know itself within that space, beings outside must find other ways to know. actions, deeds, intentions, outcomes, words, behaviors, promises, threats, spoken desires. whatever is allowed out. we have imperfect information. fog of war. we don’t know what we don’t know and we won’t know for sure until we get there. who speaks for us when we can’t speak for ourselves? that is to say nothing of deceit, lies, obfuscation. we know what we know but even if we didn’t know we still wouldn’t give you a straight answer, or some variant. they say the gods know our hearts, the beings from time beyond time may look within us move as we only move ourselves. even the gods don’t see it all, they too are bounded by their own limitations. we see a small slice of reality, they see a deeper area, and only the most high can see it all. any divine being with perfect information is indistinguishable from the cosmos itself. and so the spirit moves in us all.
