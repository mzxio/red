“you have arrived at your destination.” after i don’t know how long, the days and nights are different here. the crash log says it’s been so many hours, minutes, seconds, but what do those units count for here? arrived, yes. arrived. here? on the scans it looked like structures, and these are structures. under a protective dome, a broken dome. the scans didn’t show a broken dome. whatever’s in there isn’t gonna be in good shape. something cracked the dome, or maybe it’s just so old that it fell down under its own weight. there’s still a compound inside, what showed up on the senses. the entrance still looks intact. i came all this way, don’t have anywhere else to go. may as well go take a look.
