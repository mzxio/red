stellar alchemy. gold from the sun. all our life’s riches come from the sun. light and wind, moving over the earth. touching us all. why not reach out and use it, borrow the wind as it passes, catch the sunlight as it lands? it’s falling on us all the time like an energetic rain. capture, harness. these words sound like enslavement. not the goal here. just borrow. the wind is on its way somewhere, the sun was too. instead of landing on desert dirt, let it land on an energy producing panel. instead of just passing through, let it turn a turbine. stand between these things that would happen anyway and ask for their help. the wind and sun have always been our allies, in the right circumstances. let them be a boon. put them to work in a spirit of cooperation. they are the root of our wealth, tap into that flow. it is like making money out of thin air. stellar alchemy.
