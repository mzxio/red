almost an ending. one chapter, one book. the quiet comedown. most things that needed saying have been said. anything really important will rise urgently just before the end. between the end and the important things, what? what is there? a boredom risen of too little time. patiently waiting to see what happens, knowing it won’t be long before this all disappears. the ones who were meant to be together are together. the rest will remain apart. one by one the lights go out, systems shut down. the last time you leave a room it ceases to exist behind you. little by little only a few rooms remain. life becomes 100% of the space given to it. the rest becomes nothing. nothingness and memory. the gray realms, falling down the holes in between.

mother’s three mistakes:
shot down the custodian (stole the souls)
used the city to decide who lived 
chose a system with an unstable orbit

she stayed long enough to relay the message. tell the children what they’ll need to go on for themselves. that’s all. that’s enough.

of course we stayed, she decided to stay. i stay where she is, and where would we go?

he says yes he understands.
wilting sadness.
also knowing it’s ok, somewhere.
he left in the morning.
left a new ship too.
we can go and come back as we please. now we have a choice.
