when does aberration become the norm? when is ‘just the way things are’ no more than a weapon? to use against any who’d go against whatever rules you hold dear, whatever has been adopted by your society or generation. ‘the way it’s always been’ is the smallest of assertions. the way it has always been for you. and how long have you been here. what does ‘always’ even mean to you? we forget so much, so fast. and we are bad at understanding probabilities. the coin falls a certain way five times in a row and we might say it always falls that way, completely ignoring or forgetting the sixth time when ti falls another way. we build our own realities and tolerate no dissent. if you don’t like something, too bad. it’s always been this way. it’s just the way things are. you don’t get to change anything. but that’s not forgetting the way things are, they weren’t always so. they won’t be that way forever either. when things are different, will they say it’s always been that way? of course you know better. you were here for the old way. what then? how long before that too is the norm?
