awoken by a spider, the honored ancient. in the moment, a fear. startle. wake up. kicked out of the dreamlands. how long has spider been coming into my dreams? years that i remember. probably forever. the ancient ones, grandmother spider someone said. the beings from the early days of this world, numerous and eternal and connected. the web-minders. year after year, coming to me. waking with a jump. still the same. one more thing now. grateful. grandmother spider can signal me to leave dreams and return to the waking lands. thank you, grandmother spider. thank you for always showing me the way back to reality. before i thought you were just there to scare me, now i understand you’ve always been helping me on my way. keeping me from getting lost. thank you, spider. for all you’ve done.
