you came to me in the twilight before dawn. we held each other close despite all that’s happened. you said... what did you say? peace. that’s all i remember. go be at peace. and the sun came up and you were gone.

the wreck is still too hot to touch. it could burn forever. no way to tell. but it’s still broadcasting. a beacon. its last telemetry. what it saw when it came down. even though the ship is dead i can see what it saw when it came down. it says there are structures some days walk from here. maybe someone lives here after all. may as well try.
