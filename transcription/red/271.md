the invisible hand. moving through our stories. the force that runs through the center but is not the center itself. not the hand of the creator, the hand of the essential, the binding of the worlds, the medium of the universe that allowed those worlds to rise. the receptive, some call it. earth beneath earth. it seems to guide our course even in the subtlest ways. working with the grain of wood, with the character of sand. flowing and twisting. like the river. like the sky. shapeless shapes that give our paths their definition. the creator doesnâ€™t know these shapes but must use them to create. the universe does not begin with the creator, nor does it end with the creator. there are things in the dark older than creation. older even than death. maybe death will be there at the end of all things, but it was not there at the beginning. then there is only the invisible hand.
