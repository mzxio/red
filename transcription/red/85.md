now time is not all time, all time is now time. in the creatorâ€™s view, time does not adhere to any one set of rules. time is a substance, a means of measurement, an axis along which to perform change. time is the stuff of motion. all music, song, poetry, stories, all are animated by time. verbs as vectors, notes as nodes. without time they all crush together into infinite complexity within the infinitesimally small. a time before time. time is the loom, spinning out fine threads of being from the forever. otherwise it would be too dense for us to experience. we would all exist in eternity, unseeing, unfeeling, with no songs or stories. and why would we need any of those things anyway? we would be infinite, eternal, all seeing. gods of forever. no ego, no memory. we seem to remember existing in this way. to crave eternity from our anthill, to know that timeless time will come again. when the animus that keeps us breathing ceases, when ego is lost to the abyss, some indeterminate hereafter awaits. timeless time. in this way we carry eternity in all of us, always. we can access timeless time and search that infinite complexity for answers to any question. some answers may even be found. but now time is not all time. the search can not always work. all time may hold now time but we cannot see it all. only in glimpses can we perceive the whole.
