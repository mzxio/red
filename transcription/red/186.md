what do you do when there’s only one way out? when that way is almost certain death? here in this weird abandoned place, alone on whatever desolate rock this is, deep underground surrounded by some forgotten cache, my way out. the device has some name, some fake sounding corporate jargon with too many syllables. call it what it is. a pod with a bed. you lie down, close the pod, it makes a scan of your body, it mirrors your mind state, it sends all that information to another pod where it builds a body and a mind from the template you created in the first pod. molecularly and biologically identical, that’s what they say. most people don’t keep the copy. they travel, see new places farther than they’d ever go, then they recycle the copy and return to their original body. the real you. but here, soon, there won’t be a real me. supplies are almost gone. even if there’s more in the cache, there’s no air. just a few hours left. this thing seems to be working. it shows power, an uplink to somewhere. do i stay and die myself or clone out, leave my corpse in the pod and go on as a copy of who i was? not much time now. the choice will make itself soon.
