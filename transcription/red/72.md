#72

there wasnâ€™t any way to pull back from the edge by the time we came to it. already traveling too fast. no return. melting ice, rising ocean, falling bomb, nuclear fire, screaming rhetoric, chanting revolution, fucking our way to sweet mutual release. impossible acceleration where no gravity can ever hold. escape, release, ignite. engulf. creation, destruction, almost the purest of absolutes. a long runway, rattling and groaning, bumping, screaming. the air becomes thick like water, like ice. thick enough to stand, to fly. cocks and cunts buried deep, pointed to our hearts, riding closer and closer, bucking and breaking, crying for the heavens. push the pedal to the floor, drive the car off the cliff. the bottom drops out. zero gravity. crashing, cumming, blast off, tidal wave. necks snap on the gallows, starburst roar of death and fire. waves crashing, steel melting, hearts afire. the airplane pulls to the sky, the city disappears, all is black and white and orange and blue. they call it freedom, escape. orgasm of love and bodies, of madness, of earth, of machines and calculations. we make the new world.
