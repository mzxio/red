nothing is as it seems. when you think things will make sense, when there seem to be no lingering questions left, that is when you will be surprised the most. the smallest piece of reality holds more than you can ever experience. don’t forget that. don’t trust easy sensibility. whatever holds today may not hold tomorrow. if you don’t know what you don’t know, you never can see it all. just remember your own limited information. know what channels you have open to receive input. sometimes just knowing where you get your information can help you to determine any gaps or missing data. sometimes it’s just enough to know the borders of the slice of reality that you inhabit. just remember, borders always change. tomorrow remember to look again.
