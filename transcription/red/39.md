“don’t believe them,” he said. “they won’t tell you the truth.” $￼ and they didn’t. not in the 50 years since he said that, not for a hundred years before at least. maybe they never told the truth. maybe all they did was take. “we need this thing of yours,” they’d say. “we’re going to take it from you.” you might ask(,) “why, what do i get?” “our gratitude!” but when they take what’s yours and leave, do they ever return? do you ever get a chance to reclaim your property? do you get a way to cash in all the gratitude they supposedly gave you? no, you’re just a sucker begging with your masters. they didn’t need what they took, they just didn’t want to work for it. they just wanted to deprive you. in this way they can reinforce their superiority. they can write laws that keep you from having the things they have, then from their high perch they can make fun of you for not being them. i don’t want to be them. you don’t want to be them. but they’re very good at making us think we do want what they have. but when we follow them and get too close, they change the rules again. they don’t like us close. they want us far away where they can’t see us. where they don’t have to think of us. where they can make up stories about us without fear of correction. look. look everywhere around you today. look to history. this is what they’ve always done. they are clever, maybe it seems like they are winning. but they have always been few and we are many.
