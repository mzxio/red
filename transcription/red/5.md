don’t look at the elephant. not looking is the only way. do not acknowledge the elephant. to admit its existence is to allow total ruin, collapse of all things. it’s just a goddamn elephant. fucking look at it, don’t look at it. what difference does it make? even if it’s hiding in the corner, even if it’s trying not to be seen, why make such a fuss? fucking elephants. it’s not their fault. what did they ever do?

they come out this way long time back in my grampi’s day. weren’t nothing here then either. it were the full moon this week, biggest in all the year says the (-farmers-) girl. she reckons this is the first summer of the rest of our lives. i reckon she’s right.
