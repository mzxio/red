killing all your enemies is not a victory. when there is no one left, there is no chance for anything else ever again. it is nothing but completion, an ending, a death in total. a failure to find alternatives. when you stand among the bones of your enemies, one enemy remains -- yourself. you have become your own enemy by then. this is why serial killers keep going forever, why war-mad soldiers always find enemies around every corner, why some killers turn their weapons on themselves. the same mindset at play. if there are always enemies, there is a reason to keep going. if there are no enemies, that reason is gone. in this way your enemies may be separate, but they end up defining you.
