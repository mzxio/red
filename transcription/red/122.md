what you feed in determines the quality of what you get out. bad soil produces struggling plants. bad water makes us poisoned. thoughtless production, a mind for cost alone, these things produce bad products. thoughtlessness, carelessness, apathy, bigotry, all of them. it’s not about the absence, it’s about the quality. plants still grow in places with no sun, no water. plants can’t grow in poisoned soil or toxic water. we aren’t so diverse. we need things and we need them to be good. we can make do with less, but we cannot make do without. the plants too, they can’t just go from one state to another. they evolved a certain way. learned to live in certain conditions, but then those conditions must persist for them to continue, otherwise they die just like us. otherwise they become twisted shadows of themselves. just like us. we are like the trees, our lives are like the roots. everything we do, every incomplete project, every important moment, every little recurring thing, they become our roots. we will optimize for the soil that we’re planted in.
