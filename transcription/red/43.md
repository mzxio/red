twelve minutes past the hour of reckoning. when the air is swollen and thick with dust and fire. twelve minutes past the hour of destruction, of recreation. the new world begins here, now. day zero, year zero, hour one. the fires are still burning. the ash has yet to fall. the old world is still falling away, shredding itself into nothing but soot and debris. the screams and sirens still rising like a tide of swelling misery. groaning like the damned in their first moment of hell. crying like babies taking their first breath. the end of all things, the beginning of all things. the dead we’ll never have a chance to bury. the stories we’ll only remember by telling them to children for generations until they forget this is the new world. to them it simply is.
