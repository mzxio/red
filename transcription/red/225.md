the city begins on a plain between mountains, a valley near the sea. one line from the idealized center of the land to the sea. other lines connecting the mountains, the passages through the hills. at the nodes where those lines connect, build the first settlements. small markets, homes, warehouses, churches. more lines connecting those structures. every time runs over another line, they become bolder, wider. they become arterial roads. the settlements swell. more people move in. a central core springs up, an externally applied geometry that doesnâ€™t fit the land quite right. at the interference patterns, build and demolish over generations. the first small villages all grow together. the core district becomes dense, tall. the city sprawls across the whole valley. estates take over the hills. finally the sprawl reaches the sea. the city reaches its maximum footprint. a fire rips through an old district. it is rebuilt, but never the same. and so it goes. the city eating itself, constantly dying and reborn from the ruins. no sign of the original settlement remains. the city prospers, rich and vibrant. now it is time. bring them here.
