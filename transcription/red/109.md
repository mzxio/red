where are you on your path? is there even any way to know? do you ask someone else, outside, far away? from their distant perspective, can they tell you where you are? or will they just compare your apparent place with their own maps and render a judgement? can we even know? sometimes i think my soul is not my own. sometimes itâ€™s as if someone else has inhabited me. one me, the natural self i was born with, destined for forgetfulness, only to live and fade and at most be left as a ghost haunting some special place. the other soul, an ancient timeless one, turning off all its extra senses and coming into me. to take a ride, to watch with my eyes, to speak with my mouth. some celestial being who sees all my life and steps into me to watch some special parts. times of change and destiny. when i feel that extra capacity, and i can use a little more starstuff power than usual. then the moment passes and regular me has to live through the long boring stretches between destinies. somehow i trust that timeless self to know. i wonder if it deserves my trust.
