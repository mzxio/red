when they made the ancient music it moved inside our hearts. all fell silent except for their fingers on the strings. moving us with the smallest perturbations. a pluck here and there, a wide gesture with their arms, a sweeping wave. a thousand strings all vibrating in harmony, from the tiny tinkling of bells to the great roaring of the ocean. to battle drums and melancholic singing. they twisted and folded the sounds like dancers twist and fold their bodies. we all watched, barely breathing, not daring to break the spell cast over us. in the sound booth, the technician grinned and madly turned up the volume, saying it was worth blowing out an amplifier. the head monk directing the playing gently turned the sounds, balancing the performance of the other monks on the instrument. it billowed as a fine mesh sheet billows on the wind. when it rose in a great crest, bass deeper than hearing came into focus in the wind. the monks tuned that breeze from a foggy haze to a clear afternoon, to a gentle evening, to a rowdy night, then back again. a song of our world, of the divine.
