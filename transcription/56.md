#56

you left like a boat pushed away on a slow river. receding slowly and then vanishing, swallowed up, out of sight.

some days the valley flooded, the river rising higher and higher and then never receding. the valley became a lake. the village, if there ever was one, was swallowed up, out of sight beneath the waves. sparkling scintillating shafts of light in the green water, echoes off the cliffs. whisper of leaves like rain, pattering on the roof. the dull speak and splash of the pump, water from some deep place. reservoir, recharging over centuries, cold and deep and still. the sun shines over the valley. the wind rustles the leaves.
