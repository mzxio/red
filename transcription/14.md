roads from here go there. the rails like blood and bones. if i knew the right turns i could find you. none of this world is truly disconnected. would you even take me if i could find you? we make the disconnection. nature makes deserts, people make wastelands. the desolation is ours. we weren’t listening when they told us. we went our own way. 

the weight of yesterday, today, tomorrow. today weighs heaviest, it’s the only place you can do anything about anything. tomorrow weighs more than yesterday, there’s more at stake.
