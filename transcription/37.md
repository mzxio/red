days turn faster and faster. seasons hold their melody, a slow progression inside of (touch/these/them). “because of climate change?” he asked. “man, the climate’s always changing,” i said. far away, across the road, down the river, through the hills to the valley. we remain unseen. i try to remember but always still it slips away. as uncertain as tomorrow. it could have happened this way or that way but now i’m not so sure. they say you forget a little every time you remember something. how do i know what i’ve forgotten? how to know what’s lost? it wouldn’t matter but for this ego(.) my memories are me. they might be important.
