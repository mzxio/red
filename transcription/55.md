what is eternity? seeing something now, today, as it is, doesn’t show what it was. or will be. if today the village lives and tomorrow it dies, does it spend an eternity in death? but it wasn’t dead forever. the timelines fold in on themselves. nothing is anything forever, no matter what anything is. where am i? that makes a difference to what i see. what perceptions do i miss just not being everything and everywhere at once? the god mind is the spirit of all things. the everywhere-ness. it doesn’t need opinions or judgement, just to be. a stateful machine, in whose configuration is everything we know or see. every smaller piece is just that -- a small aspect of the whole. a contributor, observer. i am not bounded to a single timeline so i am free to explore possibilities, other states of nowness. but eternity? that i’ve never seen.

how many steps and states have i observed? the valley is not always here, but so often it is. the village is harder to find, a spark flashing in the dark and fading swiftly.
