smoke still rising, fires still burning. 

the column of smoke rises, undisturbed in the windless sky. never seems to get any closer no matter how much i walk. still the hills, the smoke, the sun. if not for the sun’s motion, the slow expanding smoke, the shadows tracking on the ground, i would think there is no time here. 
the wreck is always just over the horizon, just out of reach. what will i find when i get there, if i get there? did the ship come down in one piece? is it strewn all over a valley? will anything be left but debris? will the fire consume everything? what’s been burning so long? nothing in the ship should be so combustible. maybe it landed in a forest and the trees have caught. i haven’t seen any trees here though. not even grass. nothing for life. the senses say there’s nothing breathable. so what burns? and why does the horizon never come any closer? maybe i should just rest here.
