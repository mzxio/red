“I sure as hell hope I ain’t bullshittin’ you. ‘Bout none of this. Ain’t know what I don’t know. You askin’ me questions, me givin’ you answers. Is they the right answers? Reckon some of them is. Some of them ain’t. I sure won’t know. Maybe you will. If’n you get a chance maybe you come back and tell me what you learned. Supposin’ as my directions ain’t wrong and you don’t end up walkin’ to your death. So’s I’ll tell you what you want to know but best be keeping your eyes open. Deal?”
