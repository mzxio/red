“I sure as hell hope I ain’t bullshittin’ you. ‘Bout none of this. You askin’ me questions, me givin’ you answers. Is they the right answers? Reckon some of them is. Some of them ain’t. Ain’t know what I don’t know. Maybe you will. If’n you get a chance, maybe you come back and tell me what you learned. Supposin’ as my directions ain’t wrong and you don’t end up goin’ to your death. So’s I’ll tell you what you want to know, but best be keeping your eyes open. Deal?”
