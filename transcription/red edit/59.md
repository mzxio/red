Easy to lose each other. 

We didnâ€™t think we could, but we did. Our fragile gravity was broken. What stuck us together now drives us farther apart. Drifting into forever. Uninterrupted until we encounter some other body.

Mechanistic views. Laws of gravity. Repeatable little treatises. Smug in their clarity, their self-assurance. By the numbers. But can machines ever understand? What it is, what it means to be a soul adrift and tangled up with another soul? Like pieces  of wood and seaweed. Caught, dragging each other this way or that. Trapped in a current. Off-balance. 

That is all the safety we ever knew. Cast together after a storm, or after a lifetime drifting. Set in motion by the rains and the flood. Just as easily untangled, broken free. 

The current carries us on.
