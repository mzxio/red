We didn’t call it loving.

We called it something else. When we were in each other, that’s what it was. Something else. Desperate fleeting acts of mortality. Reaching for divine when our bodies were too small, too frail, our hearts too broken. Call it many names. Call it love, call it nothing. What is loving after all? Here and now. Enriching.

No past, no future. Bodies bent and folded, hard and soft. Poetry in motion, shuddering prose in stillness. Loving came during, after, before. At all points but one. Loving was waiting together somewhere after. Loving was a pressing need to be closer even when that was impossible. 

Loving was what we were.
