war is an articulation of dominance. the capacity to make someone do something they don’t want to do is often the capacity to do something in worse. do this thing or you’ll be wiped out utterly. the loaded weapon carries this weight. destruction or subjugation. that’s when two sides have unequal capacity. one has the weapon and one has none. rarely is it so clear-cut, beyond a single actor. war goes farther. sometimes the objective is total destruction, whereupon no choice is given. you fight back and kill first or be killed yourself. the stakes aren’t always so obvious, nor are the relative strengths of the actors. one ancient empire that dominated for centuries was almost always outgunned in their early days. they won by refusing to surrender, by wearing down their opponents. in the equation of “do this thing or i’ll do something worse,” sometimes the only answer is(,) “make me.” in this way, the most basic dynamics of power in any struggle can scale from the smallest confrontation to total war. it is useful to ask why the confrontation occurred to begin with, but often by the time the answer is made clear it’s too late to change the course of events.
