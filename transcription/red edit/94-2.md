# 94-2

Camping in the ruins of ancient cities, too vast for anyone to build. These ancients with their unknowable skills and secret wisdom. we can find their remains but never know them as they were. just find the burned out husk of some settlement, the scattered debris from some pilgrimage.

Nothing but some stones standing where a sacred site once was. Bones from a forgotten battle, covering the hills far as can be seen. Maybe all weâ€™re doing is looking at our future.
