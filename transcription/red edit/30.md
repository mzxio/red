Saying different things with the same words.

Doesn’t matter how similar we are, we come to a place where we don’t share meaning and there’s no way to start again. The same flawed tools that got us there are the tools we’d have to use to get us out. And first you have to see the problem. 

“Do you see it? I see it.”

Lost meaning. Arguing. You see what you see. I see what I see. Do we cross the bridge together or go to different places?

I’ll just leave. Nothing we say ever reaches the other. If we have such different meanings, did we ever want to really talk at all?
