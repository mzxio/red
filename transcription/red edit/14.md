Roads from here go there. 

If i knew the right turns on the road I could find you. none of this world is truly disconnected. Rails of blood and bones. 

Would you even take me if I found you? We make the disconnection. Nature makes deserts, people make wastelands. The desolation is ours. We weren’t listening when they told us. We went our own way. 

Weight of yesterday, today, tomorrow. Today weighs heaviest, it’s the only place you can do anything about anything. Tomorrow weighs more than yesterday, there’s more at stake.
