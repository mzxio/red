“They’ll let you in, but only if you pass their test.”  
  
What is your suitability, your fitness? Are you worthy of entrance? To sit within the hallowed walls? To sit at the table, to eat the food? God forbid you’d be unworthy. They’d have to turn you away at the door. 

Who are we kidding? They won’t turn you away, just charge for admission. Whatever they’d give you for free if you pass, they’ll charge you for it if you fail. Everybody wins! That’s what they’ll say. No one misses out.

If you get in free, you’re special. You’re who they want you to be. you’ll be inside. the people outside, the ones who pay, they’re not special. their money is good but they are not. in-group, out-group. you want to be in, don’t you? who knows what those out people are all about. up to no good, that’s for sure. you should definitely want to pass the test. what kind of freak would you be if you wanted to stay out there with those people? when things get tough and their money doesn’t spend, you’ll want to be inside. we can’t be responsible for you if you choose to stay out there.
