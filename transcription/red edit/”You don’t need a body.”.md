### ”You don’t need a body.”

It is possible to leave a body, go elsewhere, and then return. Some time will have elapsed for the body in your absence. one-to-one travel is easiest but however long you were gone is also the amount of time elapsed for your body on your return. it’s possible to miss a lot as your body can carry on like you were never gone. ten-to-one at least is a better ratio to attain, so for every hour of your absence only a few minutes has elapsed. much harder to reach that level of mastery over this form of travel. 

“And another thing...”

Don’t trust any landmarks. The universe is constantly in motion and we are entropy generators. Mountains and valleys can be relied upon for a while, but even they are not fixed. 

After travel you may find the meaning of words has changed. in all these cases it is difficult and limiting to always approach the world as if it is brand new to you, but overall it is best not to make assumptions about where you are. 

There will be loss.

It’s risky and dangerous, traversing trans-dimensional space. You never know what you’ll be able to take with you. Even if you take everything with you when crossing over, something will be lost. You may not even notice. Nothing may look or seem different, which in turn may lead you to believe that you were unsuccessful. Don’t be deceived. 

One unstable element is memory. Much you’ll forget without ever realizing it. Space where memory used to be remains, so you may perceive absence but fail at any attempt to retrieve whatever used to be there. This is a good sign that you have succeeded in traveling between universes.

You have likely traveled and not even known. If you experienced a time when everything stopped making sense, when all that was familiar became foreign or frightening, when all of a sudden all the things that brought comfort instead brought confusion, then you have been traveling.
