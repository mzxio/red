whistling in the caves. whispering in the grass. crouched under the moon, telling secrets. the butterfly sleeps at night, the mosquito tends the fire. burrowing animals asleep or out hunting. cool dirt crunches underfoot. leaves and trees crack and creak. gray and colorless as the sky, the smoke and the fire and the sparks, all that tells. stillness of infinite motion. folded into the mother’s mysteries, her embrace. disappearing and being reborn. god is everywhere.

too many timelines.

“for years i’ve laid my head down at night... wherever i was an odor would arrive in my nose... brine and pitch and shit. the perfume of this place.” $￼
