roving tribes wandering the desert. for generations, looking for a place that was promised. worshipping their new god. receiving commandments. escaping the old gods, battling the other gods in the desert. a pantheon of villages and cities with their own gods, their own rules. finally then to arrive at the land that was promised, the city of the covenant, and it is not virgin territory. it belongs to another tribe, another god. so the wanderers must kill all those inside, must cast down and burn all other gods. so it is that the promised few came to godâ€™s chosen land. again and again the story repeats. the old place with its big rulers, its old gods, its calcified structure. the new god with promises and adoration, given the right sacrifices. the new place, never really quiet new. the infidels who must die to satisfy a desire given divine blessing. sooner or later we are all there, fighting between the wanderers and the settled.
