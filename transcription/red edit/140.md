cycles within cycles. there is no plan, no win condition. only loss, only death. to win, go as long as possible without dying. but eventually we all lose. the essence of permadeath -- embrace impermanence, revel in whatever comes your way, be careful with resources. in the sim there are layers of beings nested one within the other until there is no more. death is just a chance to begin again.
