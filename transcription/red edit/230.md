Whoever came here, they came correct. Thought they were going to stay. Enough supplies for a clan. Enough for many, enough for one. They left it all. Bots too. Don’t have to do all the work myself. 

We cleared away the debris. Salvaged most of the buildings. Weeks getting ready. Putting up a new dome one layer at a time. The bots mostly get it right. They do the work up high. I’m not climbing up there to fix it. 

After the dome, a new house. Garden too. Planting seeds. Don’t remember the last thing fresh I ate. Long time ago. Before. 

The crash still wakes me up at night. I can’t remember something. Attacked? Who would have attacked? Nothing worth protecting but the dome. If they couldn’t fix it, would they kill for it?
