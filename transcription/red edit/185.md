what is this place? deep in the ground. the elevator just had colors. no numbers. who knows how deep this is. deep enough to lose signals from above. there’s levels like this, just storage going on and on. who was storing all this stuff, and why? i haven’t looked in any of the boxes yet. mostly all the same size. again not marked with numbers i recognize. symbols. something for automated readers. whoever built this place wanted it to last.
