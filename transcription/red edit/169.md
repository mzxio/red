Never thought it would go like this. Wrecked, forgotten, cold, hurt. Impossible doubt. Lonely like a force of nature. Impossible to escape.

Only by changing the moons and the suns and the orbit of this world in the cosmos would it be another way. Another planet in another time with other people. 

“What other people?” 

This is the crash site. Marooned. Small and cold and alone.

Maybe after walking a hundred years we would find someone else. Keep walking all the way into another age. We may yet live to see all these things and more.
