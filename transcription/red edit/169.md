Never thought it would go like this. Wrecked, forgotten, cold, hurt. Impossible doubt. Lonely like a force of nature. Impossible to escape.

only by changing the moons and the suns and the orbit of this world in the cosmos would it be another way. and then we may as well be living on another planet in another time with other people. 

“What other people?” 

This is the crash site. The place they talk about when they say “marooned.” maybe after walking a hundred years we would find someone else. if we keep walking we could walk all the way into another age. one of fellowship and cooperation. just as likely we’d walk into a war, an utter dissolution of our fragile bonds. we may yet live to see all these things and more. but now it’s just the crash, just the ruin. starting small and cold and alone.
