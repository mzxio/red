interconnectedness of all things ensures a change anywhere is eventually reflected everywhere. even some distant cousin of a forgotten family cannot disappear silently. there are always repercussions. any encounter binds timelines together. and we all encounter each other sooner or later. we canâ€™t even perceive the linkages that bind us to each other, or to our common purpose. we just see the disconnection, the difference. the distance. a universe away can be closer than the next seat over. when there is nothing left between us we will forget all this again. the separation was needed, to stretch the links that tie all things together. all thingness was divine but leads to profound forgetfulness. adding some nothingness is bitter and sad but also makes all the things that are worthwhile and beautiful and interesting. we know this with every breath though we often forget we breathe.
