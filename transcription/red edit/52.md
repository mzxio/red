she came for me in the night, just before dawn. when the light was dim and gray and the city was barely stirring. with sweet words and caresses she came, a cry in the stillness. one was not enough and two was too many. too respectable for dumpster diving, too poor for limousines. i touched her cheek, soft and sweet. cooking for her whatever she wanted, the first one. too many. still children. no respectability. pantomime of love and lust. a swirling dance with no ending and only one place to go. breakwaters, holding breaths in watery twilight. salvaged sticks and stones, a forged life. stuck together at awkward joined intersections, nothing was as pretty as she wanted it, nothing was as tender as her kisses. timid and sincere, just at the edge of darkness. trying to hold on, so desperate for control-- nothing scavenged ever stays up for very long.
