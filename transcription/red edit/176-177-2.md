# 176/177-2

The wreck is too hot to touch.

Something in the ground made it burn. Fire ice. Looks like it could burn for a while. It could burn forever. No way to tell.

One pod thrown free. Still broadcasting a beacon. No one will hear the signal. Lost in too much radiation. 

Last telemetry. Scans. Even though the ship is dead I can see what it saw when it came down. Shows a structure. Maybe someone lives here after all. Long walk from here. Supplies to live a little while. May as well try. 

Guess this is it. Best get far away from here.
