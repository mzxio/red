too many voices, too many sounds. why won’t they ever stop? the flood the flood the endless flood. why can’t i ever say what is real? all previous agreements nullified, superseded. none of what is left remains. scattered debris and dust, scattered ashes. no one can ever find the body. only if you go looking in the past. the time traveler knows the exquisite interconnectedness of it all, the complete absolute despair. there is no retrieval, only observation. you can see it but never touch. the past is gone, the future is gone. now is just a small move, a single stone on the board. together all the stones tell a story, but only in their arrangement and order, in the decisions of the player. stones themselves are irrelevant, replaceable. one for another, would you even notice? so it is with all of us. today a man in a suit sits across from you. tomorrow, different man, different suit(.) still a man in a suit on a train. would you (ever/even) care?
