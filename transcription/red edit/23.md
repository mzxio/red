a forest clearing, trees all around. crystalline plants underfoot. green light cracks and splinters. with the sun behind, grass flashing in a (-radial- radiant) glow, reflecting on some tiny reflective molecules, radial gloss almost completely diffuse. only with the light directly behind would you ever see it, and then it’s dreamlike and impossible seeming, like it defies physics, painting gentle halos around every shadow. it moves with you. following. like any light source bound to your point of view, it’s disorienting. a little scary. like shadows from a headlamp, long but almost invisible from your eyes. covered by whatever casts these shadows. grass and plants, leaves, trees, rocks, even the dust. none of us is ready to see the world this way, none of us evolved generating light that we could see. we move, shadows move, but never so perfectly. never so bound to (-pov- point of view). it reveals something new to us.
