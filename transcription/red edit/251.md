how quickly can things change? one way or another? points where our stories turn. almost impossible to explain later. in between it could be years, generations. we forget why things were the way they were, why people thought as they did. what seems important to them seems trivial and overdone to their children. their children in turn think their parents concerns are overplayed and soon theyâ€™re back to repeating the mistakes of their great-grandparents. some things you have to learn the hard way, no amount of history or collective memory will save you forever. the children have to learn their own way in their own time. they will teach themselves. some will know what came before, maybe enough to prevent terrible damage in the learning. the lesson that kills is no lesson at all, just a death sentence. that is how fast things can change. all of a generation turns in an instant from one reality to another. if there is something to bee learned it will be experienced, if not learned right away. the learning takes time. little by little maybe we remember more, maybe we stop repeating some mistakes.
