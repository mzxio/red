years go  faster and faster but seasons stay the same. the smell and the air and the passage of the sun, these are the only calendars that we need. time to plant the crops, time to work the fields, time to bring in the harvest, time to rest and work inside. on earth anyway . this is the natural way of things. on other worlds, other seasons. other natures. the farmer becomes one with the land and learns its melodies. the rhythm of its seasons, in symbiosis instead of exploitation, these melodies may be sung generation upon generation, in harmony. even when the floods come or the deep winter seems to never end, the land and the farmer provide for each other. but just like these years, just like the seasons, remember that nothing lasts forever. nothing is truly constant.
