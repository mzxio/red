Don’t look at the elephant. 

Not looking is the only way. Do not acknowledge the elephant. To admit its existence is to allow total collapse.

“It’s just a goddamn elephant. Fucking look at it, don’t look at it. What difference does it make?”

“If it’s hiding in the corner, if it’s trying not to be seen, why make such a fuss?”

“Fucking elephants. it’s not their fault. what did they ever do?
