what is left? dead in limbo. throwing sticks, rolling bones. augurs and signs. divination of the rocks. heaven, earth, fire, water, mountain, wind, thunder, lake. the ancient elements. an old computer transmitted in abstract design over the tenuous airwaves. fragments of essential pieces, recompiled imperfectly and revised for millennia. even the philosophers who studied their whole lives didn’t know for sure. they changed their minds more than once over the centuries, revising history to erase any evidence of uncertainty. later philosophers didn’t even know, they labored under false impressions for years themselves until even more was discovered. little by little they came to their own understanding. then they die and another generation forgets. on and on until the ultimate forgetting, when even the philosophers are close enough to the divine to at last pinpoint the source of the transmission.
