what answer is anyone supposed to have? the ones who want something, don’t give them what they want. the ones who don’t ask, how do you know their intent? if they’re peddling answers, they want you to believe as they claim to believe. do you know what they really believe? two versions, at least. outside and inside. the real answer and the answer that was given. sometimes the same, or mostly not. everything is true. nothing is true. hard to tell the difference. later when you know the answer it’s too late to make a change. you can’t go meddling in the timeline for any sleight or con, you carry that stuff with you over the threshold. some you can change, most it’s just not worth it. until you come back around again for another shot. most of us, we’re stuck here. living by our wits alone.
