Faults in forever.

Every day sends out its signal, its light. No light will guide us here. There is no way, no path. No way forward. Only broken stars, the ones that fell to earth. Predestined accidental collisions. After, before, all around. 

“They wouldn’t listen.”

“You feel it or you don’t. You make your own determinations.”

“Were they really mine?”

“How many times did we come here? No one remembers. A long eternity.”

“Eternity’s not that long.”

Every day the rain falls on the water. Every day the raft rises and falls with the tide. No one remembers the way it was before. They tell stories to remind themselves, but none of it is true. There is no true. We all have a different vision. 

“How and why and who, what difference does it make? What is old, what is new?”

“We’ll all come back around again.”

”Eventually we’ll change places.”

“We already have.”
