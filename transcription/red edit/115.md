Walking into an empty place to live alone forever.

Everyone else far away. A few weeks’ journey at least. Someone to visit once or twice a year and trade. Friends. One day there is no visit. They wait for an arrival and there is none. Eventually they forget.

Something eventually kills us all, but some things kill us sooner if we don’t get help. The loners die earlier when they can’t get help to live. Maybe that’s me.

Years and the friends are old. Their children make the trip. For the first time on a dare, or maybe retracing some forgotten old paths. Until they find the place. And that’s it. Some corpse in an undignified place.

Solitude until the end.
