“Like the tide coming in.”

Those long nights up until late. Looking for something. I was looking for understanding. I understood so little. Finding it was my priority. She had other priorities. They all did. Everyone I met in those days, touched, talk to. Every day that’s true.  I wonder what they saw in me. 

Transparency of self, opacity of other. Fog of war. We see what we see.

“We all have our motives.”
