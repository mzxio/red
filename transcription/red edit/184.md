this place was beautiful. once, before the dome fell, there was a garden here. trees, plants, water. all frozen, all dead, all desiccated. all the buildings are open, airy. it must have been pleasant like a summer day back home. with all the windows wide, birds singing. i wonder if there are bird bones somewhere in this mess. most of the dome stayed up, just one big tear cutting through the center, like it failed or was damaged only a little. enough to do this. the houses are intact. impossible to say how old. old enough. maybe there’s a person’s bones in here too. there’s no logos anywhere, no branding. this place must have belonged to a person, or people who weren’t affiliated with any company or government. maybe that’s why they were all the way out here in this private oasis. there’s worse places to die. maybe they left something i could use. not much time left. guess i’ll search the houses.
