my coming was foretold in the ancient texts. it was directed that me or someone like me should come here, now, at this time. as i was directed to come here. you really don’t remember, do you? it was so long ago, easy to forget. it wasn’t necessary to remember. this was in progress before we got here, it will continue after we leave. another like me will come, will keep coming until there are none left. you too. your coming was foretold too. the same text that told you i’d be here told me i’d find you when i got here. none of this is a surprise. it was how it would always be, because we made it so. now there’s one more thing we have to do, one more task to undertake. we didn’t only come here to meet, though that would be enough. no, we are here to do something.
