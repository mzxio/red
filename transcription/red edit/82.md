there’s no way to hold on to words in dreams. the letters rearrange themselves when you look. you may know what a thing says, but you’re not ever reading it for long. its meaning is simply known to you. understanding this can help escape dreams when you get trapped in nightmares or running down infinite hallways or wherever the dreamland has you. remember that all the dreamland is comes from you. the walls are built from you, the scenarios are assembled from you. if you are lost in dreams you are lost in yourself. if you receive a message, you are communicating with yourself. whoever you are, wherever you come from, that is the bound of your dreamtime. lost in the memory palace. so you’ll dream in color if you think in color. you’ll dream in text if you think in text. but always remember to focus on something in the dreamtime, anything at all, whatever you’re in front of when you think to focus. see if it changes. the dreamlands are unstable, much more unstable than the waking world. if the words fail to hold their shape you’ll know where you are. you make this land.
