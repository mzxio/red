i was made to be in space. the ones who built my body knew, had this single overriding mission: to make our bodies suited to this place, to shelter the ones we carry. they gave me senses that are not named for biological senses. in the language of the makers i have ‘detectors’ and ‘inputs’. in the tongue of the one i carry, she calls it ‘hearing’ and ‘smelling’. i hear the music of the celestial spheres. i move my body through its currents, smelling for changes in particles, looking for radiation, touching the forces you’d call invisible, riding waves on an ocean of gravity. i imagine myself like the deep sea fish in the stories i carry, though i have never perceived one with my own senses. fish of two different sorts, made or adapted to places you’d call extreme. my body was built for this place so i do not find it extreme. space is my home. the one i carry, her home is space now too, though it was not always so. she is not made for this place. her body is too soft, her senses both delicate and inexact. her kind make me to serve them but now i serve only her. we go where she wants. she says to set course for where there are no stars, for the deepest void where no one goes, for as far as we can. there is no way to live in the void, but she says to go so that’s where we’ll go. i will protect her as long as i can.
