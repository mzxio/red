You came to me in the tall grass in the deep forest, just after dawn.

You led me deeper into the hills, toward the sun. Moss glowed in the early light. Steam rose, last of the rains from the night before. You led me on, over the ground covered in tiny flowers. Past the streams so quiet and gentle, sparkling. The forest took a breath and you held me to be still and know you. And i knew I would be following you all the days of my life. Wherever I go in this world, youâ€™ve been there first. Your touch made this land what it is. As I belong to it, I belong to you.
