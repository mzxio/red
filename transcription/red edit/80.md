Nothing is real until we make it real.

So much depends on individual actors who simply decide to act a certain way or do a certain thing. When they make it real, they leave the door open for adoption. In imagination a thing can be real for one person, in stories it can be real for all.

It will seem so obvious. “Why didn’t anyone think of this sooner?” someone will ask. To live in such enlightened times when we have at last thought these things! Forgetting days when things not such a way, and the days when such a thing wasn’t even real.

Why didn’t we think of it sooner? Someone did, and the story was lost. “That’s just the way things are,” they’ll say.  All the while not knowing what we still don’t know, what even at this very moment may be getting dreamed up. 

It didn’t exist for us, therefore it did not exist at all. Our view was too narrow and exclusionary. When an idea comes directly from imagination and goes to story, it skips the manifestation required to satisfy unbelievers. “It’s just fantasy,” they’ll say. Later when fantasy becomes reality they’ll believe.

Thus the fool becomes the prophet.
