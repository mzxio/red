An unspoken promise to return. 

How long was it? 

Black hairs turned to gray. Stopped counting so long ago. Years if there were years. Decades if there were decades. It all runs together now. A lifetime. 



When he lands on the plain and comes out to meet us he too is gray and old, just like we became. A little different. Our paths diverged all those years ago. He walked a different road. We’ll never know. Still he kept the promise and returned. 

Now we have to decide. 
Go with him into his world and leave our own?

“Would he stay?”

“No, he won’t stay. We go or we stay. Our choice.”

After so long, didn’t think there would ever be a choice. Not really. Distant hopes remained ever distant. In the end having no choice became a kind of security. We knew where we’d always be. 

“I see how he looks at us. Weight of all those years.”

“Wishing our roles were reversed?”
