Little by little, time takes it all. 

First the memories. The smells, the sounds, the exact shape of things. It leaves the feelings at first. Then it takes more. Artifacts break, degrade, get lost. It all ends up as trash at the wayside. The shape of things changes so there’s no way to reconstruct an exact scene. Impossible to put the pieces back together.

Eventually it’s only the feeling left, a wisp of old music recovered from some archived recording. Memory overwritten so many times that even its configuration, the arrangement, is in doubt. Only the smallest feeling now, warmth in the heart from a sun long gone, a season past.

Anniversaries are the hardest. Swimming in feelings, drowning in what’s left of memory. Wishing for just one more moment.
