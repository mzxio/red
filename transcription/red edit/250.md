living in two places. dwelling in the past and the future, all in the present. different bodies made up friends, built from whatever was left of what was here before. no one remembers because no one knows. the work of building is past, now the long work of maintenance. keep the lights on. tend to the garden. in the end there will be no higher calling. waiting and watching. the custodian.
