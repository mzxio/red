birdsong. someone said at the end of a slaughter all that was ever left was blood and guts and birds talking from the trees. until all is blasted and ruined, reduced to soot and ash, minerals, components... as long as something remains, there are the birds. the birds and the cats in their eternal struggle, their game. why would they care about our blasted hellscape? the cats and birds, they’ll take care of each other. the wreckage is still warm, still smoldering. picking through melted shapes that were once familiar. no coded impressions. all is noise and tormented blank vision. until a curve comes into focus, a familiar pattern emerges. then the shock, the horror. what was just rubble and ruin suddenly becomes a familiar facade. a building, an artifact, a corpse. it looked like junk, like nothing. then it comes into focus and bones blackened, charred flesh, some congealed bubbled fat. all the components that should never been seen separate, displayed and scattered carelessly. the casual horror of it all. the ones left living can be shocked and then numbed. what was abhorrent becomes the norm. they pick through the rubble. they find what’s left. the birds sing through it all.
