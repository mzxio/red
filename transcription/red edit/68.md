Not until we tell the stories.

Not until we experience can we begin to make sense. We can never subtract ourselves because they are our stories, our experiences. Objective, subjective? Only intersections. Categories serve to insulate us from something we can never escape.

We want truth but there is no truth. 

I don’t know what happened to me because it’s never been entirely up to me. I’ve never been able to tell the sum total of my story. If I could, I would just tell you my part and leave it at that.

The experience becomes the story becomes the experience.

”If there was a God, it would be the sum total of the universe. So let God be all that is and don’t separate god-ness from un-god-ness.“

In endless rebirth we become infinite.
