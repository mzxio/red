It’s not until we tell the stories that we can begin to make sense of our time. Not until we experience that we can participate.

We can never subtract ourselves because they are our stories, our experiences. We want truth but there is no truth. Only intersections. Objective, subjective? Categories only serve to insulate us from something we can never escape. 

“I don’t know what only happened to me because it’s never been entirely up to me. I’ve never been able to tell the sum total of my story. If I could, I would just make it me and leave it at that. If there was a god, it would just be the sum total of the universe. So let God be all that is and don’t separate god-ness from un-god-ness.“

The experience becomes the story becomes the experience.

In endless rebirth we become infinite.
