at a council of war, remember why everyone is there. if you don’t know, ask. but don’t expect a straight answer. there is only ever one reason for war: control. there are many roads that lead to this one destination though. war is a means to an end. even wars undertaken frivolously, or simulated wars with no real blood shed, these are still expressions of dominance, of control. to take more than is taken, to give more than is given. to show that you can destroy more than your enemy wishes to lose. any war, any weapon, this is its message, its power. articulation of destruction. a war goes until someone has had enough. who knows how long that can take. some weapons make people stupid. sometimes when the sides are too evenly matched, they can’t express dominance so they wait each other out. wars of attrition are the worst wars ever waged. no one can ever win. winning is different in every case. sometimes winning is just about saying you won and not being challenged. sometimes it’s who loses less. in whatever case, the winner is usually whoever gets to tell the stories. “history is written by the victors” said someone. that is consistently true, but leaves something out. some wars go on so long the combatants don’t know they’re fighting, some histories are written before the victor is known. but at its heart, war is just a test: who has the bigger stick, who can destroy the most, and how much will that destruction cost? we are all warriors.
