the last full moon of winter. precession advance. restless retrograde. casting between the last phase and the next phase, just emerging into a new season. still and quiet on the day given for stillness. one sabbath in one ancient religion. the day they said god rested after creating the heavens and the earth. is it all too evenly spaced? is there room for randomness, the true god purpose of creation? not the ancient legends, not the stories told and retold, repackaged generation by generation? no one here knows. too many cycles deep, the original truth is gone. and little wonder, when we forget what is just passed by only a few years. truth shifts, changing, never static. maybe there was one truth long ago but now there are more truths than us. we carry more than one truth inside.
