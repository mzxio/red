the history they tell you isn’t yours. it’s not even theirs. it’s the history that they made to tell themselves. the way they wanted it to happen. whatever doesn’t fit, discarded. any story outside theirs, unworth telling. unless it serves their purpose. it is in their interests to make us savages, wild animals. beasts that attack in the night and kill you in your bed. never mind that’s what they do. they are the savages. we lived on this land, cared for it, for centuries before they came. will they last as many centuries? no. their way is ravenous, destructive. they will strip the land of all its riches and move on, leaving us with whatever ruined earth is left. they are the savages, the beasts of civilization. they say civilization is good, the epoch of our lives. we should want to be civilized. but i see what civilized people do, who they are. they are nothing to be emulated or revered.
