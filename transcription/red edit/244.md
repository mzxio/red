Can’t remember. 

Memory can’t be trusted. Illusion everywhere. Forgetting. It all runs together. Unending. Once I forgot the forgetting. They called that childhood.

Playing games. A grid of spaces. Players occupy one space each. Pieces can move to other spaces using special rules. They can be in the same space together, or interact with each other across spaces. Signals and weapons and what else?

The object of the game is survival. You may survive by destroying all your opponents, or by reaching agreements with them, or by escaping. The winning state changes. Who else is playing? 

Don’t do what the rules of the game tell you to do. The game isn’t what anybody tells you it is, it’s what you make of it. The game is just a set of pieces. You can move them however you please, assign any meaning you choose. You can make up your own rules. Add new pieces or take away old ones. Make your own pieces.

We all make up our own rules. Sometimes we use someone else’s rules. Other times there are no rules.
