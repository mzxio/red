The last human. 

When everyone else has moved on, died their unnatural consequences, been reborn elsewhere, one remains behind. Walking the empty sidewalks in the city. Looking over the finite ocean. It ends somewhere, over there just beyond the horizon.

“We don’t go there any more.”

She sits in the empty restaurants, the quiet shops. No one comes here any more. The food in the market never goes stale. Processes suspended. Little by little all the normal pieces fall away. Unreality takes their place. Dust stopped in the air. Eternally, meticulously, unnaturally clean.

She is not alone. The cycles still run. Animus. Wild life, sun and moon and stars. Some other beings still dwell here. None like her. In the desolate city they somehow always run into each other. Convenient excuses. The last passengers on a sinking ship. Waiting for the last flood. Shutdown. The end.

 The end comes cold and quiet and sudden but she waits all the same.
