far from anywhere, the canyon lands. big scars on the ground, worn away by the ages. years beyond count. once every century a bird flies down and sharpens its beak upon a stone. in a thousand visits you wouldn’t know it had been there. the bird has been visiting longer than counting. water runs its way here and there and carries the sand along with it. the wind follows the water, blowing away anything left dislodged or unstable. the bird, the water, the wind. they all made this place. from here it goes on forever, but it doesn’t go on forever. the long desert, flat and undisturbed, quiet and (wanting/waiting). the mesas with their hidden secrets and forgotten history. the mountains tall and cold even now in these warm season.s the grasslands, with their infinite skies. the canyons seem to go on forever but they are bounded by all of these. go in any direction. choose wisely or don’t, and you will will arrive at a new place from here. walk along the canyon rim or turn around and walk away. this place will be waiting all the same. waiting for the bird to return, waiting for the rain. maybe you should too.
