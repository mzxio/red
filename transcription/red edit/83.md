# 83

Walking down the old train tracks.

Most everyone’s gone home. Evening or the weekend or both. The sun hasn’t quite set, the idle part of the day between afternoon and night. The part of town with rundown old buildings, still in use. Junkyards and overgrown weeds.

Going around the edges, gravel and overgrown grass. Places between the fences to slip through. Places to hide. Some days it’s needles and bottles under the trees. Some days it’s old people riding in caravans. 

There’s a man and his dog. Set up high with a chair. Watching the day, watching his property. I try to go around. Don’t want him to see me cutting through. He stops me, yells something.

“Why would you want to walk so far out of your way?”

I tell him I didn’t want to upset him or the dog. He shakes his head. Comes down, shakes my hand, leads me through.

His hand was dry, dirty. On my hand there’s dirt and grease now. Stains where he touched my shoulder. A mark of hard work and friendship. I smell the grease and sweat and it is the most precious thing in the evening light.
