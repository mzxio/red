# 19-20

panoramic--

the airplane taxies on the runway, sun low on the horizon. we stop, we go, we wait. i reset the song playing. lean against the window. wait. we’re in line. red and blue livery on the plane in front. white and blue taking off. they go. we’re up next. breathe deep. the plane turns. its stink of human bodies and cleaning solvents and greasy recycled oxygen. 

“flight attendants, prepare for takeoff.”

then the bass. the pilot kicks the plane into gear. the wings shudder. we’re rumbling on the asphalt. quaking, veering only a little from side to side. i feel her pulling in the breeze. then, weightless. the ground drops away. no more bumpy crude rubber or dirt(.) gear pulls up. the light sweeps through the cabin, sparkling off the wings (-in my eyes-). we come out on a long lazy turn, out over the pacific. los angeles wheels behind, then under us. chasing into the twilight, toward the desert and the mountains. we all breathe a breath. the cabin dings.

“it’s now safe to use those electronic devices.”
