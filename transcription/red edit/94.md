how much wreckage is left out there that we don’t even know about? old probes sent by now long dead civilizations who walked themselves into oblivion for whatever reason? old spacefaring tribes who were nomads of the stars, leaving one home for the next? what wars were fought, running battles from world to world, from rock to cloud to sun? what junk was left twisted and broken, timelessly waiting on some airless moon? what were they fighting for, and who were they fighting for it? and if anyone could ever find their lost scrap, would we even want to know? or would it just be remnant of ourselves, nomad kin finding the bones of their ancestors on the long road. camping in the ruins of ancient cities, too vast for anyone to build it seems, these ancients with their unknowable skills and secret wisdom. we can find their remains but never know them as they were. just find the burned out husk of some settlement, the scattered debris from some pilgrimage. nothing but some stones standing where a sacred site once was. bones from a forgotten battle, covering the hills far as can be seen. maybe all we’re doing is looking at our future.
