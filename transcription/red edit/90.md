there is no way for memories to provide sustenance. you cannot eat the memory of a fruit and receive nourishment, no matter how sweet that fruit is in memory, in hunger. it can distract only. never feed, never heal. reminiscence, recollection of people, places, or times, they are the same. nothing alive to be found there. at best it preserves a depiction of what’s been lost, giving breath to a shallow simulacra. to remember the dead is to keep their ghosts alive. to remember the living is to fragment their spirit, separating who they were from who they are from who they became to you. is any one of those things their true being? whatever their true self is, you don’t have access to it, especially if all you can do is remember them. the best you could accomplish is holding on to who they were, but eventually even that becomes a shallow automaton, a reflection in broken glass. important pieces will be missing, always, just as they may have been missing when you first experienced those qualities that you now recall. we may be children of the infinite, but we are beings of the present. don’t feast only on fruits that can never sustain.
