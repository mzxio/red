“how was your trip?” she asked. as if that’s all that happened. a leaving, some traveling, a returning. how was the trip? all such trips share a characteristic, this defining quality. there is no “how” or any detail but the smallest. how were the roads, how were the people met there? how was the weather? how was the local water when supplies ran low? how was the sun in the sky, at the shore, in the desert, in the forest? did the other life bite when it was disturbed? ask the bugs and beasts how my trip was, they will have a different answer. how is any trip to seek out the answer to a mystery? did you solve the mystery or not? was it even a mystery to be solved or just contemplated? the answerless answer. the goal at the end is never the same goal at the beginning. if it is, you haven’t gone far enough yet. how was the trip? something was found, something was lost, something that was unknown became known. that is a good trip.
