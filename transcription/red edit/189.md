I decided to stay.

I thought I’d go. Just get it over with.


The pod scanned me.

`Remote system online.`

“What does that mean? Where will I go?”

The pod said it was ready to perform the procedure. Maybe there’s someone on the other end. Just as likely there’s no one and I’m sending myself to die. I let it send me on ahead. Worth a try. 


How long have I been down here? A week, a few days? The air is fresh. Recirculated. I found scrubbers, tanks. There’s food I can eat down here too, and water. Seems like I could be here for a a long time. Whoever built this place, they built it to last.


Maybe there’s tools to make repairs. No reason not to keep looking.
