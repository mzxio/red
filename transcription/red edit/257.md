in the old city they measure us by how much money we’d give them. lifetime value, that’s what they called it. LTV. that was our worth to them. that determined our usefulness, and their savvy. anything to increase it either through new products or services, capture and retention. if we were high value we were worth supporting and listening to. if we were low value we were irrelevant and ready to be discarded. if we approached our estimated limit we could be discarded as they’d already made their money and our continued patronage was no longer necessary. we were no longer necessary. once we were no longer a customer, unless there was a chance we might become a customer, our value dropped to zero. that’s how they saw the world in the old city. how they saw people. maybe some of them thought it was a problem to think and act that way, but mostly they wanted to do it more. bigger. when it all went wrong they wished they’d taken more.
