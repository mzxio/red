in society, nothing is real until we make it real. so much depends on individual actors who simply decide to act a certain way or do a certain thing. when they make it real, they leave the door open for social adoption. “that’s just the way things are,” they’ll say later, forgetting the day when not only were things not that way, but the day when such a thing, whatever it was, wasn’t even real. in imagination a thing can be real for one person, in stories it can be real for all. then it will seem so obvious. “why didn’t anyone think of this sooner?” someone will ask stupidly, taking a bit of foolish pride to live in such enlightened times when we have at last thought these things. all the while not knowing what we still don’t know, what even at that moment may be getting dreamed up. why didn’t we think of it sooner? someone did, but the story was lost. our view was too narrow and exclusionary. it didn’t exist for us, therefore it did not exist at all. when an idea comes directly from imagination and goes to story, it skips a step of manifestation where those unbelievers can be satisfied. it’s just fantasy, they’ll say. later when the fantasy becomes reality they’ll believe. thus the fool becomes the prophet.
